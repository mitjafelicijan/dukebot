# Dungeon Lore Compendium

## Introduction

Greetings! I am Loremeister Minorou, and welcome to a series of dungeon lore bits designed for copy-pasting directly into party chat during a dungeon run. “What is the history of this place? Who is this boss? Why are we here?” These chunks of lore answer these types of questions, one 255-character paragraph at a time (to fit within the chat restrictions within WoW).

I ask that you please use your best judgment. Ask your party beforehand if they’re fine with getting a lore dump. Explain that this will likely slow the run a bit. Some players might be in a hurry and just want to get through the dungeon as fast as possible. Respect that. Don’t go pasting paragraphs of text right as a boss is pulled or while someone is explaining a new strategy. Do it while running towards the dungeon, between pulls, or during breaks. Be considerate. The lore should add to the experience, not distract from it.  
Warcraft is a longstanding series with many different authors and sources. It was inevitable that there were contradictions here and there. I’ve done my best to choose the most appropriate option whenever I came across mutually exclusive pieces of lore. Thankfully those weren’t common, but if you read something that doesn’t seem right, that might be the reason why.  
A **bolded section of text** indicates the name of a boss in a dungeon. I have them in rough order of when you’ll encounter them, give or take, as some dungeons have spawn variation or you can approach them in different orders.

A **_bolded italic section of text_** indicates the name of a rare spawn. Sometimes you’ll see them, sometimes you won’t. Many don’t have any lore attached to them, so it’s no big loss.

A green section of text indicates an encounter, usually an npc or questgiver in the dungeon.

Pink sections of text indicate optional text. All of the text is technically optional as you can edit these for your own personal use as you see fit, but pink text specially marks information that is from outside the vanilla timeline, meta commentary, or simply just cracking a joke. This kind of text might be less appreciated in RP servers. Include or exclude pink text at your own discretion.

Blue text refers to information applicable to the Alliance.

Red text refers to information applicable to the Horde.

## Dungeon History

Deep under the Cleft of Shadow in Orgrimmar lies the volcanic caverns of Ragefire Chasm. It is home to troggs, satyrs, lava elementals, and a sect of the Shadow Council cult known as the Searing Blade.

It should be noted to avoid confusion: the Burning Blade is the larger cult sect outside of Orgrimmar. The Searing Blade is the cult sect within Ragefire Chasm.

The Shadow Council is a group of warlocks and other servants of the demons of the Burning Legion. The cult was first formed by Gul’dan in Draenor, before the orcs invaded Azeroth during the First War.

The Shadow Council kept the scattered orc clans together to form the first version of the Horde. It was they who pushed the orcs to drink of the blood of Mannoroth.

This demonic blood gave them great strength and bloodlust, but also shackled them into being slaves of the Burning Legion. Their brown skin turned green with the corruption.

The orcs were a savage army under the demon’s control. In a mere forty years, they drove the draenei to near extinction and nearly destroyed their home world of Draenor, then set their sights through the Dark Portal to conquer Azeroth.

During the Third War, Grom Hellscream eventually freed the orcish race by destroying the pit lord Mannoroth. You can see his broken glaive in southeastern Ashenvale, in Demon Fall Canyon!

Understandably, Thrall, Warchief of the Horde, is wary of the Shadow Council and the role they played. He considers them traitors to the orcish race.

It’s been four years since Orgrimmar’s been founded. Thrall knew of their existence here long ago. Why has Thrall waited so long with the cult so close, practically on his doorstep? Why not destroy the cult right away?

Because Thrall is a smart man. You don’t crush the scouting ant when you know the nest is somewhere nearby. Thrall watched, and waited, seeing if any clues from this sect would lead him to the elusive Shadow Council leaders.

Alas, Thrall has waited, and the search has not borne fruit. This cult has not given any useful information, and it is dangerous to let them fester here for too long. That is why we are here… to root them out.

## Bosses and Encounters

**Oggleflint** and his troggs were the original inhabitants of Ragefire Chasm until the Searing Blade moved in. They were too weak to resist the dark powers of the cultists, so they retreated back here. They are not happy with the arrangement.

At his feet is the body of Maur Grimtotem, a tauren who found something of interest here in the chasm. However, the troggs vented their frustrations at their situation and beat him mercilessly to death.

The troggs don’t have much interest in material wealth and left his belongings alone. It is unknown what he found as we never look inside the satchel he carries, but was it worth his life? Rahauro, servant to Magatha Grimtotem, will know.

**Taragaman the Hungerer** is a mo’arg, better known as a Felguard. He poses as the “leader” of the Searing Blade as a deception to kill inexperienced Horde adventurers. The real leaders are further within the cavern. Because of course they are.

**Jergosh the Invoker** rejects the ideals of orcish pride and honor. He co-leads the Searing Blade along with the satyr Bazzalan. Though we fight him here, he survives this encounter and attempts to steal the Book of Medivh many years later.

**Bazzalan** is a satyr, a demon made by the corruption of a mortal; usually a night elf. He, like Jergosh, co-leads the Searing Blade in an attempt to corrupt Orgrimmar from within.

![Deadmines](https://i.imgur.com/kiN7glR.jpg)

## Dungeon History

Gold is an extremely important resource for us. It’s our primary form of currency, after all! Prior to the first war, the Deadmines were considered the greatest source of gold in all human lands.

The Deadmines has had a long history, and yes, it was always called that. During the First War, the hero Anduin Lothar entered the Deadmines to retrieve the Tome of Divinity from the clutches of a band of ogres.

The Tome of Divinity is an extremely important book to the clerics of Northshire Abbey, as well as all paladins worldwide. It is through meditations on this book’s contents that paladins learn how to resurrect the dead.

Also during the First War, the First Warchief of the Horde, Blackhand, had a disobedient daughter named Griselda who fled into the Deadmines with an ogre named Turok. She was subsequently slain by the orcs for her insubordination.

Moonbrook, the town outside, was once the hub of commerce for all of Westfall. However, the entire town was destroyed by the Horde during the First War on their march to Stormwind.

Moonbrook was rebuilt years later after the Alliance was victorious in the Second War. Its affiliation with the Alliance was short-lived, however, as the Defias Brotherhood took over soon after the Third War. But I’m getting ahead of myself.

Remember when I said the Horde marched on Stormwind? They succeeded. Stormwind was reduced to rubble during the First War. It took a monumental effort and many resources for the stonemasons to rebuild Stormwind to the glory that it is today.

It took a veritable army of architects, engineers, and artisans to craft the human capital. Edwin VanCleef was the leader of the massive project. When the reconstruction was complete, Edwin met with the nobles to collect payment.

Thanks to the meddling of Lady Katrana Prestor, the nobles of Stormwind refused to honor the government contract as agreed. Edwin was enraged that the nobles would withhold payment for honest labor.

The stonemasons rioted in the streets, in an event that would tragically result in the accidental death of Queen Tiffin Wrynn. With the death of his wife, King Varian Wrynn cast the stonemasons out of the city.

In response, Edwin formed the Defias Brotherhood, a large group of bandits, thieves, and brigands in defiance of Stormwind. In truth, Katrana had played both sides, and fanned the flames of conflict without arousing suspicion of her true intentions.

The Defias established a presence all over the human lands, but VanCleef himself sequestered himself into the Deadmines, where he began work on his secret weapon.

## Bosses and Encounters

**Rhahk’Zor** is a foreman in charge of Edwin VanCleef’s construction projects. It’s unknown if he’s from the ogre band that was here from the First War, but it’s likely that he’s the brains behind VanCleef’s secret weapon. Yes, I’m serious.

You sometimes don’t see him on shift duty, but **_Miner Johnson_** can be found here. He’s just a working man of no meaningful significance. Are we really going out of our way to murder him? Sometimes I wonder how much killing we do without question.

**Sneed** is a lumbermaster and pilots a goblin shredder. They’ll be needing a lot of lumber for their grand project. Interestingly, while he’s in his shredder, he has hair, but when he falls out, he’s bald. Did we hurt him that badly?

And hey, if you look on the screen in his shredder, you can see Kerrigan from Starcraft!

**Gilnid** is a master smelter and crafter of automatons. He was cast out of Booty Bay for his insane experiments and for being too amoral, even for goblins. Gilnid doesn’t care for the Defias’ mission, but they give him supplies, and he gives them weapons.

Ah, and here it is! Edwin VanCleef’s secret weapon! This giant boat is actually an Ogre Juggernaught from the Second War era! These things were monsters! Filled to the brim with firepower so that hardly anything could stand in their way on the seas.

Rhahk’Zor would likely have known the plans to build this thing. Sneed would supply the lumber. Gilnid would create the metal fittings and weaponry. It all builds up to this grand reveal.

Clearly, VanCleef wants to sail this thing to Stormwind and demand his payment. If they refused, he’d bombard the city and reduce it back to the rubble that they built it up from. Poetic, is it not?

**Mr. Smite** is the first mate of the ship, under Captain Greenskin. He is one of the very few Tauren bosses we ever face, and a fan favorite! Though never confirmed, it’s implied that he survives this encounter and lives in exile in Pandaria.

**Captain Greenskin** is the captain of this fine ship, in the employ of Edwin VanCleef. He unfortunately doesn’t get a pirate hat. At least, not until the next expansion, when he suddenly gets one.

**Edwin VanCleef**. Head of the stonemasons that built Stormwind, and now leader of the Defias Brotherhood. Now, we’re here for his head. His daughter, Vanessa, is watching. She will remember this moment well.

It’s unknown how **Cookie** became the cook of this ship, but he is what he is. He, too, survives this encounter to eventually become captain of the ship. Well, I suppose there would be a vacancy if Captain Greenskin is dealt with…

![Wailing Caverns](https://i.imgur.com/rSVdQRp.jpg)

## Dungeon History

Back when the world was new, the land that eventually became the Barrens was lush and full of life. The Sundering, which shattered the world into multiple continents, eventually turned this land into a dry savannah.

Many years ago, a night elven druid sought to bring life and greenery back into the Barrens. This druid, named Naralex, created the oases found throughout the Barrens. He eventually came upon a network of caves filled with natural springs.

As the waters poured forth from the fissures in the ground, they produced sounds similar to loud cries; hence the name of the “Wailing Caverns”.

Naralex went to sleep and connected to the Emerald Dream to enhance the energies of the Caverns and spring forth new life. However, the Emerald Nightmare took hold, trapping Naralex and twisting the Wailing Caverns.

The waters turned foul. The docile creatures grew and turned into vicious deadly predators. Naralex’s former acolytes created a new cult in light of this transformation – the Druids of the Fang.

A Disciple of Naralex, a lone tauren acolyte named Muyoh, awaits us at the entrance of the Wailing Caverns. He tasks any who enter to end the nightmare that has taken place here.

## Bosses and Encounters

**Kresh** wanders the caves, oblivious to the nightmare. Oddly, his mind is strong enough that the corruption does not touch him. As such, he lives a relatively happy life here. Are we really going to ruin his day just to take his shell?

**Lady Anacondra** was once known as Scarletleaf. She was the first acolyte to volunteer to join Naralex’s expedition to the Barrens, and unfortunately, nearly the first to break when the nightmare took hold.

**Lord Pythas** was once known as Aryn. He was a childhood friend to Naralex. While he was a quick study in druidism, he was also quite skilled as a warrior. What a fancy-pants class double-dipper. He was Naralex’s personal guard before his mind broke.

**Lord Cobrahn** was once known as Jarlaxla. He used to be renowned for his mastery over many different animal forms, but now he refuses to take the form of any animal but a serpent’s. Figures that being evil gives you the cool animal forms.

**Skum** is a thunder lizard that entered the Wailing Caverns in order to escape from the heat of the Barrens. He quickly succumbed to the corruption here, becoming stronger as a result.

This **_Deviate Faerie Dragon_** is a rare sight. Faerie Dragons are said to be closely tied to the Emerald Dream, where they halt the misuse of magic. They are also said to be immune to magic. That’s clearly wrong, since we can use magic on it…

**Lord Serpentis** was Naralex’s finest student, but he was ambitious. He wanted to become a “shan’do” like Naralex was – an honored teacher. When the corruption spread and insanity took root, he rallied the acolytes to form the Druids of the Fang.

**Verdan the Everliving** is an elemental guardian of the Wailing Caverns, formed of the lush foliage that grew here. After the corruption took hold, the Druids of the Fang somehow allied with it, and Verdan will crush any who trespass.

…kinda pointless for it to guard the deepest part of the dungeon, though, isn’t it? It’s not even guarding anything.

**Mutanus the Devourer** is the corruption in Naralex’s mind made manifest. It is not a murloc, exactly, but rather an aberrant nightmare that took the form of Naralex’s deepest fear… which happens to be an albino murloc. Naralex is afraid of murlocs.

![Shadowfang Keep](https://i.imgur.com/Yy1GNnW.jpg)

## Dungeon History

Shadowfang Keep was not always known by that name. It was originally a human castle, home to the lords of Pyrewood Village, and part of the kingdom of Gilneas.

During the Third War, the undead Scourge, led by the Death Knight Arthas, attacked the magic city-state of Dalaran in search of the Book of Medivh.

When Arthas found the book, his Lich and BFF (Best Friend Forever) Kel’Thuzad used the book to summon the eredar lord of the Burning Legion Archimonde, who destroyed the city. You might have seen that purple bubble in Hillsbrad. Yeah, that’s Dalaran.

Archmage Arugal was a member of the Kirin Tor, the ruling council that makes up the magocracy of Dalaran. He fled the destruction of the city to his homeland of Gilneas.

As the Scourge encroached upon the outskirts of Gilneas, King Genn Greymane approached Arugal to come up with a way to protect the kingdom. Arugal began looking into the forbidden research of a Dalaran mage named Ur.

Ur’s research told of the worgen. Arugal was fascinated to learn of the worgen’s strength and ferocity, and decided to delve deeper into shadow magic to figure out how to summon them, against the wishes of the Kirin Tor.

He successfully learned the secret and told the Gilnean King. To his surprise, Genn responded that he would stop at nothing to defend his people, and gave his approval to use the worgen as a weapon against the Scourge.

The project was wildly successful. The summoned worgen tore through the ranks of the undead and ripped them to shreds. However, as the number of undead waned, the uncontrollable worgen, looking for new prey, turned their claws against the Gilneans.

Those not outright killed by the worgen would be afflicted by the worgen’s curse, turning into worgen themselves. The Gilneans had traded ill fate for another. They retreated behind the grand Gilnean gate and closed it, sealing themselves inside.

So, it’s entirely Arugal’s fault that the worgen eventually join the Alliance. To be fair, they were Gilnean beforehand…

With nothing else to target, the worgen ravaged the countryside, eventually killing the inhabitants of the castle near Pyrewood Village.

Wrought with guilt and driven into madness, Arugal adopted the worgen as his children (hence, “Son of Arugal”) and moved into the castle, now renamed Shadowfang Keep. Here, he began working in service to Alpha Prime – the first worgen.

As an aside, the worgen in Duskwood were summoned by the Scythe of Elune, which is tangentially related, but isn’t really part of the story of Shadowfang Keep.

## Bosses and Encounters

Arugal is not fond of people trying to break into Shadowfang Keep. **Rethilgore** is a particularly vicious worgen that Arugal entrusted to capture and guard any trespassers.

The prisoners here were sent to investigate the situation. Deathstalker Adamant, the Forsaken, was sent here with his colleague Deathstalker Vincent to scout the defenses of the keep to prepare for an assault. Vincent met his final death here.

Sorcerer Ashcrombe was sent from the Kirin Tor to see if Arugal successfully repelled the undead from Gilneas. He did not know the tragedy that befell here until now.

Interestingly, that guy uses the spell Khadgar’s Unlocking to open doors. Mages used to have that, but not anymore! Just like how rogues used to be able to use bucklers and had a disguise skill to change the way they look.

**Razorclaw the Butcher** earned his nickname from the name from the many humans he slaughtered when he first moved in. The fact that he’s here in the kitchen is a coincidence.

Ah, this is **Sever**! He is only here during the Scourge invasion. We are quite lucky to see him, and should take this chance to take him down!

**Odo the Blindwatcher** is a worgen that had lost his eyesight long ago. However, as you can probably guess, his other senses have become more keen as a result.

He took up keeping bats as pets because… I don’t know. I know they’re famous for echolocation, but contrary to popular belief, bats also have exceptionally good eyesight.

**Baron Silverlaine** was the master of this keep before Arugal and his worgen forcefully took it over. He remains rather honorable even in death.

Not much is known about **Commander Springvale**, other than that he was likely a paladin in service to Baron Silverlaine.

**Fenrus the Devourer** is a giant Worg, and Arugal’s favorite pet. When Fenrus detects its prey, it lets out a roar that can be heard from everywhere in the keep. Despite being a beast, its loyalty to Arugal is deep enough that hunters cannot tame it.

**Wolf Master Nandos** is the packmaster. He trains and takes care of the lesser worgs here. He stands as the last line of defense before we face Arugal himself.

**Archmage Arugal**… summoner of the worgen to Gilneas and mad usurper of Shadowfang Keep. He is quite tough for a mage. Still, after his defeat, he has quite the future ahead of him.

In the future, he will be resurrected by the Lich King as a minion, then killed. Then in the shadowlands (the afterlife), death knights will find him, and kill him again to make their weapons stronger. Life and death is cruel like that.

![Stockades](https://i.imgur.com/m9qpPsn.jpg)

## Dungeon History

The Stockades are a prison complex beneath the canals of Stormwind city. Criminals of all kinds are imprisoned here, including petty crooks, murderers, prisoners of war, and traitors to the crown.

A recent revolt from the prisoners has resulted in chaos – the cells are open and the inhabitants are organizing. The guards have been driven out and regrouped outside the entrance, determined to not let a single prisoner escape.

This operation is simple – we’re going in to quell the revolt.

Many quests here are from people unhappy with the justice system taking too long to execute these criminals. Those questgivers weren’t aware of the riot… they essentially requested us to come in to murder people on death row.

## Bosses and Encounters

(Many bosses here spawn in different locations, and the order in which the party encounters them depends on which direction the party goes)

**Targorr the Dread** was the supreme executioner of the Blackrock orcs in Redridge Mountains before his capture. He was brutal, even by orcish standards. He tortured many Alliance soldiers before killing them mercilessly.

**Dextren Ward** made his business digging up bodies from Raven Hill Cemetery in Duskwood and selling them to a necromancer named Morbent Fel. Dextren’s assistance may have propelled Morbent’s ambitions, as he eventually succeeds in becoming a lich.

Little is known about **Hamhock**. He could be a captured ogre from Duskwood, in which case he’d be a Splinter Fist Ogre. He might be a member of the Defias, like Rhahk’zor in the Deadmines, so he might know how to build VanCleef’s Ogre Juggernaught.

**Kam Deepfury** is one of the few non-Defias prisoners here. He organized the destruction of the bridge at Thandol Span between the Wetlands and Arathi Highlands.

It’s rare to see **_Bruegal Ironknuckle_** here, but that’s about it for lore. I got nothing. He’s a rare spawn and has relatively decent loot. Go nuts, guys.

**Bazil Thredd** is Edwin VanCleef’s lieutenant, and the leader of the riots here in the Stockades. He hadn’t had any contact with the outside world for years during his imprisonment, but recently he’s been having a mysterious visitor each week.

Perhaps something from those visits triggered the riots. Who knows? Perhaps we can discover the truth by digging deeper into the mystery through the questline.

![Blackfathom Deeps](https://i.imgur.com/BO94jLn.jpg)

## Dungeon History

Millennia ago, the night elven temple Lathar’Lazal was built in reverence to Elune on the western edge of the world, back when it was a single continent. The name, translated from Darnassian, meant “Seat of the Sky”.

Queen Azshara, the beloved ruler of the Kaldorei Empire at the time, directly oversaw its construction. She used her magic to weave the rivers and seas around the sand and stone as the masons worked, ensuring the temple would be as beautiful as possible.

Gem-encrusted bridges. Sparkling, bubbling lakes. Even the wildlife moved in to the temple to enhance its brilliance and reverence to Elune and nature itself. Night Elves from all over the world would come to visit this mystic place of worship and wonder.

Alas, it wasn’t to last. During the Sundering, which shattered the world into separate continents, Lathar’Lazal sank into the Veiled Sea. For millennia, it was thought to be lost to the ages.

The Old Gods’ corruption run deep within the earth of the planet. One such Old God, though unnamed, had its influence reach the underwater ruins of the temple. Aku’mai, favored pet and servant to that old god, made her residence within.

The Twilight’s Hammer cult, dedicated to worship of the Old Gods, noticed the corruptive power and travelled to its source. At the beach of Zoram Strand, where the ruins of the ancient night elven city of Zoram lay, they found a cavernous path.

Deep within the caverns, they found Aku’mai within the ruins of Lathar’Lazal. They basked in her presence, but found that she was in a weakened state. They vowed to feed her more power so that she may unleash destruction upon the world above.

In addition to the Twilight’s Hammer, groups of naga and satyrs have also noticed this surge of ancient power, and moved in to investigate for themselves.

In its broken and sunken state, people have taken to calling the ruins of Lathar’Lazal “Blackfathom Deeps” instead.

## Bosses and Encounters

**Ghamoo-Ra** was once a peaceful being, but the Twilight’s Hammer tortured and tormented it for years. They flayed its body and mind until it succumbed to madness. Satisfied, the cultists left it here to defend against intruders.

**Lady Sarevess** is a magical researcher, specializing in ritualistic barriers. The Twilight’s Hammer cultists granted her this private cove and continuously send her fresh sacrifices in hopes of keeping in her good graces.

Though the cultists worship Aku’mai, the terrifying beast pays no heed for her worshippers. The cultists hope Sarevess’ rituals can help protect them from Aku’mai so they can continue to serve the Old Gods without being killed in the process.

**Gelihast** heeds the whispers of the Old Gods. Though he shares the same “masters” as the Twilights Hammer cult, he does not care for them. When he first entered Blackfathom Deeps, he slaughtered nearly a dozen cultists.

Impressed by this display of brutality, after the cultists repelled him, they allowed him to stay within the caverns, albeit at a distance. Gelihast built his own shrine to the Old Gods to offer sacrifices to and receive the Old Gods’ blessing.

**Lorgus Jett** is among the leaders of the Twilight’s Hammer cult here. He’s investigating the water elemental spirits within the crystals around Blackfathom. He believed they would help their aquamancers summon water elementals easier.

Those crystals, the Sapphires of Aku’mai, interest the troll Je’neu Sancrea at Zoram’gar Outpost. He believes the naga are using the crystals to strengthen their weaponry. Perhaps these Sapphires of Aku’mai are more useful than we know.

**Baron Aquanis** is a corrupted water elemental, though what exactly corrupted him is unknown. Take your bets – who’s thinking the Old Gods? How about the Twilight’s Hammer cult?

When the cultists moved in, many of the creatures in the pool of the Moonshrine Ruins were fished up and killed for food. Not **Old Serra’kis**, though. He was too big and too tough. Any who tried to hunt him ended up dying in the attempt.

**Twilight Lord Kelris** commands the Twilight’s Hammer within Blackfathom Deeps. It was he who figured that Aku’mai was the herald of the Old Gods’ return to Azeroth.

He convinced himself that if he gets enough favor with the Old Gods by protecting Aku’mai and nurturing her growth, he will be granted immortality. He goes so far as to feed Aku’mai his own subjects to sate her hunger.

…the statue Kelris was standing before depicts Queen Azshara in her naga form, so the statue must be a recent addition. The temple was lost during the sundering, before the Queen turned into a naga, and the naga had only recently discovered this place.

**Aku’mai** is a three-headed hydra with an insatiable appetite for living flesh. She carries within her a small spark of the Old Gods’ power, and as such is worshipped by the Twilight’s Hammer as a sign of the Old Gods’ return.

Even though she is in a weakened state, she is vicious and killed numerous cultists that have been trying to assist in her growth. If left unchecked, she could rise in power to become a threat to Azeroth. We’re here to take her down before that happens.

![Gnomeregan](https://i.imgur.com/cpRN2Z4.jpg)

## Dungeon History

Gnomes know very little of their history, as in their very nature they are forward-thinking, rarely looking to the past. However, we do have some morsels of pre-Gnomeregan history.

Early gnomes dwelt in the caves of Dun Morogh. Being curious creatures, they focused on technological advancement. When the early dwarves arrived in the area later, they were surprised at the gnomes’ ingenuity.

The dwarves also sensed some kind of mysterious kinship with the gnomes. Whether it was their mutual tendency to live underground or their propensity for industry (though in different directions), or something else entirely…

The dwarves sought to aid the gnomes, who were considered somewhat frail and struggled for survival in harsh environments compared to the sturdy body of a dwarf.

The dwarves assisted the gnomes in planning, digging, and building what would eventually become the gnomish capital city of Gnomeregan. This wondrous techno-city was perfect for the gnomes, and technological progress accelerated.

During the Second War, both Ironforge and Gnomeregan were besieged by the Horde. Both cities proved impenetrable – the gates of both cities were unbroken, and the dwarves and gnomes killed many orcs and ogres using traps and explosives.

A few weeks into the siege, the Alliance moved into Dun Morogh and defeated the Horde forces. Grateful for this gesture, the gnomes and dwarves officially joined the Alliance.

The Alliance eventually won the Second War, in great part due to the efforts of the gnomes, who aided in the war with their technological marvels such as flying machines that scouted enemy placements and their submarines to sink enemy warships.

During the Third War, the gnomes were conspicuously absent. Their hated enemy, the troggs, had begun attacking Gnomeregan from tunnels underneath the city, and gnomes worldwide were recalled to defend their home.

While this seems at first selfish, the gnomes did this to prevent the trogg armies from breaking through Gnomeregan and attacking Ironforge, forcing the dwarves to withdraw from the Third War. They were holding the line to prevent a war with two fronts.

For five long years they defended against the troggs, but nothing worked. The troggs kept digging past all defenses laid against them. High Tinker Gelbin Mekkatorque, elected leader of the gnomes, was at a loss; the troggs would break through soon.

Gelbin’s best friend, the ambitious Sicco Thermaplugg, advised a new plan: evacuate the gnomes, then open pressure valves on their machines to release radiation through the lower portions of the city. With a lack of options, Gelbin went with the plan.

The plan went poorly. While the radiation indeed killed a few troggs, the rest absorbed it and became stronger. Even worse, they released more radiation than expected, which reached the evacuating gnomish population.

In truth, this was Thermaplugg’s plan all along. He always wanted to lead the gnomes, but became envious when Gelbin was elected instead. Over the years, he plotted and schemed to orchestrate the events that led to that day.

In the end, 80% of the gnomish population were either killed or turned into leper gnomes by the radiation. The remaining 20% fled the city and were taken in by the dwarves of Ironforge. The few remaining gnomes long to retake their city.

We are here to assist the gnomes in reclaiming their lost city. High Tinker Mekkatorque calls for the assassination of Mekgineer Thermaplugg for the crimes of treason and genocide.

We are here to steal Mekgineer Thermaplugg’s machine schematics, as they seem quite advanced. Retrieving the plans and reverse-engineering them could improve goblin shredder technology immensely. Nothing more, nothing less.

And hey – if we find some useful equipment for us along the way, all the better.

## Bosses and Encounters

**Grubbis** is a trogg that took especially well to the radioactive gas that flooded the city. He grew much larger as a result. He scours the ruins of the city looking for areas with the highest concentrations of radiation.

Thermaplugg watches Grubbis as a particularly interesting sample. Grubbis’ pet, Chomper, helps him search for gas leaks.

This **Viscous Fallout** was a water elemental that lived in the aquifer around Gnomeregan. When the radioactive contamination seeped into the aquifer, it poisoned the earth and water. This elemental seethes with anger at its painful corruption.

Lieutenant Tom “Sizzlepants” Crankle is considered something of a hero among the leper gnomes for being the only one to survive piloting the **Electrocutioner 6000**. It was Mekgineer Thermaplugg’s first attempt at making a super-charged mechano-tank.

It was built specifically for using electricity as its main weapon, but was never really tested for safety or effectiveness. As such, it has claimed the lives of many test pilots.

Gnomish inventors would compete for status by pitting their creations against each other. The **Crowd Pummeler 9-60** was invented by Oglethorpe Obnoticus. You may recognize the name – he built the mechanical chickens we can find out in the world.

Back in the day, Thermaplugg stole the Pummeler’s blueprints and created a giant version of it, then let it loose in the city to wreak havoc. The ruling council of Gnomeregan thought Oglethorpe was responsible.

As a result, they banished him from the city. He fled to Booty Bay, where he now makes his home. Angry at his mistreatment, he disavows any association with Gnomeregan. That’s the reason he’s neutral, and why the Horde can learn Gnomish Engineering.

It’s rare to see the **_Dark Iron Ambassador_**. This hints at a potential alliance between the Dark Irons and the leper gnomes, with this man being the envoy between them.

**Mekgineer Sicco Thermaplugg** is a traitor to the gnomish race. After inciting chaos behind the scenes and betraying Gelbin Mekkatorque, he was responsible for the irradiation of the city and the near extinction of the gnomes.

He fancies himself “King of Gnomeregan” as a twisted joke. Though he is crazy, he is also brilliant, which is why he has made it this far. His machines, and his machinations, stop here.

If only temporarily. This “Thermaplugg” is a body double. Eventually, Gelbin Mekkatorque and the real Sicco Thermaplugg will face each other for a true showdown.

Thermaplugg tries to kill Gelbin with a wired trap, but fails, accidentally getting cut in half in the process. His mech suit cauterizes his wound. Gelbin leaves him on the cold floor of Gnomeregan for the troggs or rats to finish him off. A lonely death.

## Dungeon History

When the world was young, back when there was only a single continent, the first animal life that sprung forth were blessed and tied to the planet in a way no others could be. Azeroth itself gave rise to spirits and demigods to safeguard nature.

To name a few: Agamaggan, the Razorboar. Aviana, the Mistress of Birds. Cenarius, the Forest Lord. Malorn, the White Stag. Omen, the Elune-Blessed Wolf. Tortolla, the Wise. Ursol and Ursoc, the Twin Bear Lords.

Though there are many, many more, the focus of our story today is the demigod Razorboar Agamaggan. Many demigods participated in the War of the Ancients ten thousand years ago against the Burning Legion.

Agamaggan’s fury against the demons was something to behold. He slew his enemies by stomping the ground with his massive hooves, breathing corrosive acid, and raining thorns from his back. He even held off against the Pit Lord Mannoroth.

After slaying thousands of demons, he succumbed to his wounds in the area that would become the southern Barrens. Where his colossal body bled into the earth, massive thorny vines grew that twist through the earth and formed the Razorfen.

The quilboar, believed to be the mortal offspring of Agamaggan, worship Agamaggan and pray for his return. They hold onto \[Blood Shards\] as they believe them to be crystallized gemstones of their god’s blood.

Razorfen Kraul was recently conquered by a quilboar crone named Charlga Razorflank, and under her rule the quilboar have begun attacking rival tribes as well as nearby Horde outposts. These acts of aggression make her dangerous.

Some also suspect that she has been meeting with agents of the Scourge.

## Bosses and Encounters

Heralath Fallowbrook is a druid that came to the Kraul to learn about Agamaggan as well as root out the source of the corruption here. He didn’t understand why the offspring of a proud and noble demigod would be acting in such savage, evil manner.

Soon after the quilboar captured and brutally beat him within an inch of his life, a dwarf named Henrig Lonebrow was similarly captured. The dwarf was here on Explorer’s League business to learn more about the ancient gods rumored to have fallen here.

Heralath was too weak to leave, so he begged the dwarf to escape the Kraul with the message of what was happening here. Henrig dashed out of here, but was killed during his escape; his corpse can be found under the Great Lift in the Thousand Needles.

Willix the Importer was captured while looking for Redleaf Tubers here in the Kraul. Now, he’s willing to pay to get out, but not without looking for Tubers along the way; especially rare Blueleaf Tubers. Don’t begrudge a goblin for pinching coppers.

The quilboar regard the reading of stones and crystals as the highest form of shamanism. **Roogug** is one of their most esteemed diviners and geomancers. Over the years he has quietly collected many crystals to use as spell components.

**Aggem Thorncurse** is considered the greatest shaman of the Death’s Head tribe. As they revere their demigod Agamaggan, he calls upon boar spirits to aid him in combat, much like powerful shamans of other cultures call upon spirit wolves.

**Jargba** is a Death Speaker, which is something of a prophet in their terms, which preaches that Agamaggan will one day rise from the dead. Jargba became infamous for his use of mind domination to subdue dissidents.

Death Speakers not only disseminate propaganda among the tribes, but they also enforce Charlga Razorflank’s rule by disciplining those who refuse to obey. Death Speakers also silence any who speak ill of Charlga’s new apparent allies in the Scourge.

**Overlord Ramtusk** serves as the commander of the Razorfen military forces. His thick hide bears scars of battles from centaurs, harpies, orcs, and tauren. He’s aged and experienced, which lends him well to leadership.

As he’s gotten older, he leans more and more on the quilboar spiritual leaders to help guide his thoughts. He sometimes meets with Death Speaker Jargba and Aggem Thorncurse for advice.

_**Earthcaller Halmgar**_ is rarely found in the Kraul, but other than that, there is nothing particularly notable about her.

Impressively large boars are revered in quilboar culture as they evoke the image of Agamaggan. Thus, **Agathelos the Raging** has spiritual significance to the tribes. However, even spiritual significance doesn’t protect him from manipulation.

The Death’s Head tribe discovered that ingesting Kraul bat guano produces a maddening effect on boarkind. They’ve been force-feeding it to Agathelos to induce a state of madness and use him as a powerful weapon against their enemies.

It’s rare to find the **_Blind Hunter_** named Groyat deep in the caves of Razorfen Kraul. This is just speculation, but given its pale appearance and the fact that it’s blind, it likely only dwells in darkness. It may very well be an albino.

It was by **Charlga Razorflank**’s command that the tauren were driven away from the southern part of the Barrens. She lied to her followers that spilled blood was required to revive their fallen god, which spurred the attacks.

She is a powerful leader and geomancer – the dome of Razorfen Downs was through her skill in shaping the land. She’s also had dealings with the ogres in Dire Maul, and partially reformed the land there for the ogres’ benefit.

It is unknown why she has been consorting with the Scourge, but her ambition can’t be underestimated. With Charlga dead, the threat of war with the quilboar should cease. The threat of her Scourge allies, however, remains.

The quilboar, believed to be the mortal offspring of Agamaggan, worship Agamaggan and pray for his return. They hold onto \[Blood Shards\] as they believe them to be crystallized gemstones of their god’s blood.

Razorfen Downs is considered to be the capital city of the quilboar race. You might notice the large boar’s head we need to walk through in order to enter – that is said to be the skull of Agamaggan himself, thus the place is considered holy ground.

Much of the dome that consists of the Downs was terraformed by the geomancer Charlga Razorflank, who commanded the Death’s Head and Razorfen tribes and holed up in Razorfen Kraul. She left the maintenance of the dome to Chugara Razorflank.

It seems Charlga’s meetings with the Scourge were successful, as they have established a foothold here. The Scourge, however, aren’t nearly so keen on peaceful negotiation. The lich, Amnennar the Coldbringer, forcefully took control of the area.

They’ve slaughtered many of the quilboar in Razorfen Downs and raised them as undead minions. The Death’s Head quilboar are secret servants of the Scourge, keeping the truth hidden from their fellow tribesmen.

It is unknown whether Charlga’s aware of the Scourge’s betrayal of the quilboar. Maybe she’s complicit in their scheme, or perhaps she’s yet another pawn. Regardless, we will end their presence here.

## Bosses and Encounters

**Tuten’kash** was a nerubian that fought in the War of the Spider against the first Lich King, Ner’zhul. During battle, he was blinded, killed, then raised in undeath as a crypt fiend. He has proved especially prudent as a commander.

Since he is blind, he decorates his lair with extremely fine webs that are nearly invisible. These delicate fibers can detect movements down to the lightest touch, alerting him to his prey for ambush.

This strategy has left him quite sensitive over the years, however, so extremely strong vibrations tend to disorient and enrage him.

Sah’rhee is an ogre magi captured by the quilboar. He has nothing for us except his thanks for freeing him. In the future, he will be recaptured here and killed. Adventurers could interact with his corpse and kill his ghost… how rude.

Henry Stern is a friendly human thankful to anyone who would save him from the murder pens. He hails from Stormwind, and was captured while looking for herbs. He is willing to teach alchemists and cooks exclusive recipes if they are capable enough.

Red clothing and the suffix “-strasz” hints that Belnistrasz is a red dragon in a human guise. The red dragonflight, dedicated to protection of life, abhor the Scourge for its mockery of it. It makes sense that the reds would investigate this place.

There is nothing to be noted about **Plaguemaw the Rotting**. He is simply a named undead quilboar.

This striking display is the work of **Mordresh Fire Eye**. He was once an orc shaman sent from Orgrimmar to investigate the strange situation going on here in Razorfen Downs. Mordresh did not expect to find the Scourge, however, and was slain.

The Scourge leader here saw potential in him and raised his corpse to serve. He was infused with fel energies to sear the flesh of the living, as the elements would no longer hear him in undeath.

Mordresh was always skilled in inciting his allies into a violent frenzy. It’s only natural that he do the same with his newfound skeletal minions.

**Glutton** here isn’t nearly as interesting as his predecessor, Tartek the Enraged. The Lich Amnennar the Coldbringer created Tartek the abomination to assist him in setting up his base here in Razorfen Downs.

Tartek the Enraged marched in and single-handedly killed more than 1,200 quilboar here, leaving plenty of corpses for Amnennar to raise an undead army and establish the first major Scourge outpost on Kalimdor.

This led to Tartek the Enraged becoming memorialized in Scourge literature, “Compendium of Fallen Heroes,” as one of the most powerful abominations ever created.

He eventually fell apart, and his remains were used to make Glutton, who is significantly weaker. Poor Glutton; he can’t really live up to that kind of legacy. Still, he lives up to his name by eating the spoiled corpses of the boars around here.

**_Ragglesnout_** is a rare sight here on the Spiral of Thorns. It is interesting to note that he’s not undead – perhaps he’s struck a deal with the Scourge, or he’s a mind-controlled puppet for the outside world to see?

For being one of the first liches we come across in our adventures, **Amnennar the Coldbringer** is quite accomplished. He participated in the Scourge’s assault on Mount Hyjal during the Third War. When that failed, he laid low and awaited orders.

Soon enough, he received orders from the Lich King to establish the first major Scourge outpost on Kalimdor. Amnennar found the quilboar to be easy targets, as they were desperate for power and easily influenced.

Establishing the base in Razorfen Downs was a comparatively brilliant move, as it was relatively hidden from prying eyes but was still within striking distance of Orgrimmar and Theramore.

A lich’s soul is encapsulated in a powerful magic item called a phylactery. When slain, a lich will resurrect itself due to the power of the phylactery unless the phylactery itself is destroyed. As such, liches are extremely difficult to kill.

Amnennar will survive this attack, as we will not find his phylactery here. Such is the resilience of lichdom.

![Scarlet Monastery](https://i.imgur.com/EvMfxV8.jpg)

## Dungeon History

The Order of the Knights of the Silver Hand was created by the Alliance in response to the devastating dark powers of the Horde during the First War. Through it, Archbishop Alonsus Faol and Uther the Lightbringer created the first paladins in Azeroth.

The Scarlet Monastery is a place of burial, learning, training, and worship. For years, it served as a beacon of light for Lordaeron, training many priests and paladins in service of the Alliance, to great effect during the Second War.

However, the paladin order would be truly tested during the Third War. What follows are multiple separate strings of fate that eventually weave together into the tapestry of the bloody red “L” that forms the banner of the Scarlet Crusade.

During the Third War, Prince Arthas Menethil suspended the paladins from service for their refusal to purge Stratholme’s civilians. The Order was horrified by Arthas’ actions, and believed that the prince had become somehow compromised.

High General Abbendis was an influential human leader of a growing faction in the Order of the Silver Hand, was intolerant of the “lesser races”, and believed that the retaking of Lordaeron from the Scourge during the Third War was a human matter.

Alexandros Mograine, with his weapon the Ashbringer, went to Stratholme to purge the city of the swarming undead. During the attack, he was betrayed by his own son, Renault, who picked up the legendary sword and impaled his father with the Ashbringer.

Such an evil act of betrayal from a holy sword corrupted the legendary blade. Inquisitor Fairbanks, who witnessed the event, ran swiftly to the nearby town of Hearthglen to tell the tale.

Most disbelieved Fairbanks’ testimony and accused his mind being addled by the taint of undeath, and executed him. There were, however, a few who did believe him. They were horrified at their comrade’s actions, and left to form the Argent Dawn.

Those who remained formed the Scarlet Crusade, under the leadership of General Abbendis. They wholly dedicated themselves to the eradication of undeath from Lordaeron, without the help of the “lesser races”.

As such, the Scarlet Crusade is a fanatical offshoot of the Order of the Silver Hand. The Argent Dawn is also a branch off the Order, albeit a much more even-handed one.

You may notice that the symbol of the Scarlet Crusade is a red “L.” It is a red, bloody version of Lordaeron’s sigil. The Scarlet Crusade, twisted as it is, is the few last living remnants of Lordaeronian culture.

Some Forsaken may take offense to that. So I repeat that last statement – last living remnant.

## Graveyard

Before the fanatical downturn of the Crusade, the graveyard was a place of peace and rest. Now, however, it’s become a den of Scourge, ironically enough.

Most undead that face the Scarlet Crusade are killed. Intelligent undead unfortunate enough to get captured are sent to **Interrogator Vishas**, who takes great pride in his “work”. His cruelty and sadism lends well to his job.

James Vishas was always this way. As a young kid growing up in Southshore, he’d torture frogs he found. He has a wife named Nancy, who lives in a cottage east of Lordamere Lake in Alterac Mountains. Vishas survives this encounter to become a gladiator.

This statue in the middle of the graveyard likely depicts Mereldar, sister to Lordain, a war hero who sacrificed himself in battle during the Troll Wars 2,800 years ago. His heroic deed was great enough that the kingdom of Lordaeron was named after him.

Though a celebrated warrior herself, after the death of her brother, Mereldar began seeing visions of the Light. She became one of the first beings on Azeroth to practice and wield holy power, and sparked the movement that began human religion.

Not much is known about the rare **_Azshir the Sleepless_**, but he is dressed like he belongs in Stranglethorn Vale or Tanaris. Judging by his loot and abilities, he may have been a warlock in life.

The rare **_Fallen Champion_** was a paladin of the Scarlet Crusade, but was killed and raised as part of the Scourge. Unable to use the Light, he now fights like a warrior. He’s like a precursor to the Risen; undead Scarlet Crusaders raised by a Dreadlord.

It’s rare to see **_Ironspine_**, but there’s not much to say about him. Fight onward and crush the Scourge forces!

**Bloodmage Thalnos** was once a mage in the Scarlet Crusade that was fond of torturing recruits under the guise of “purifying” them. He contracted the plague and rose as a magic-infused skeletal being who roams the graveyard as his own personal domain.

## Library

The Library wing of the Monastery holds many books, artifacts, and art. While it used to be a place of study, as the Crusade grew more fanatical, more and more knowledge became forbidden here as they contradicted their edicts.

**Houndmaster Loksey**, as his title implies, is the captain in charge of training the hounds which the Scarlet Crusade uses to track their foes, living or otherwise. His methods are effective, and his fearsome dogs can tear victims apart within minutes.

Loksey was almost sent to Light’s Hope Chapel as a Scarlet Crusade emissary to the Argent Dawn, but his older brother, Huntsman Leopold, was sent instead. Leopold believes that Loksey can barely train his own dogs, let alone represent the Crusade.

Aside from his stellar fashion sense, **Arcanist Doan** is one of the most powerful mages in the Scarlet Crusade, and keeper of the Monastery’s library. He is trusted with guarding the Scarlet Key, which unlocks access to the other wings of the Monastery.

The Council of Six in Dalaran, the leaders of the Kirin Tor and among the most influential mages in the world, has recognized Doan for his mastery of his variant of the mana shield, which makes him near invulnerable for a few seconds.

Doan has a crush on High General Abbendis’s daughter Brigitte, who inherited the title and is now called High General Abbendis. She’s currently stationed in Tyr’s Hand. Later on, she will become the Commander of the Scarlet Onslaught in Northrend.

## Armory

Full of arms, armor, siege weaponry, and ammunition, the armory was the “military wing” of the monastery where recruits and veterans alike would come in for martial training.

There is only one notable boss at the end of this wing. He stands in the Hall of Champions, which holds memorial statues of influential figures of past champions of the Scarlet Crusade.

We have some time. Let’s explore the past of these people, and we’ll behold their statues as we get to the end. You’ll come to find that, despite the xenophobic tendency of the Crusade, they still honor members of the other races in their service.

Arellas Fireleaf was a High Elven citizen of Quel’Thalas. The exact details are unknown, but this High Wizard is somehow locked in eternal combat with a necromancer named Diesalven. He was memorialized for this sacrifice.

Admiral Barean Westwind was a human Kul’Tiran who was the Grand Admiral to the Scarlet Fleet, the main naval force of the Crusade. He was lost to the Frozen Coast of Northrend.

Dorgar Stoenbrow was a dwarven warrior for the Crusade, with the title of Lord of the Red Caverns. The meaning of the title is unknown. He was last seen in Alterac Mountains, presumed lost or dead. He may have relatives in Ironforge.

Fellari Swiftarrow was a High Elven citizen of Quel’Thalas, and Ranger Captain of the Crusade. She was lost in forests of Silverpine, possibly against either the undead or the worgen.

Ferren Marcus was a human citizen of Stratholme, and High Abbot of the Scarlet Monastery. He died defending the Monastery during the first Summertide Assault, which was the Scourge’s first attack against the Monastery during the Third War.

Harthal Truesight was a human citizen of the subcontinent of Azeroth: the human lands south of Khaz Modan. He was a paladin of the Knights of the Silver Hand, and was killed during one of the many attempts to purge the undead from Stratholme.

Holia Sunshield was a human defender – a shieldmaiden of sorts. Her citizenry is unknown. She died while slaying the dreadlord Beltheris. It’s unfortunate that his death was not permanent… demons can only truly die if killed in the Twisting Nether.

Invar One-Arm was a human citizen of Dalaran. He was the first Chief Assassin of the Crusade. He was lost in Northrend and never seen again. However, his sword, Serilas, the Blood Blade, can be found in the prison of Ulduar.

Orman of Stromgarde was a human citizen of – any guesses? – Stromgarde. He was the first Captain General of the Crusade. He was lost at the mouth of Icecrown Glacier in Northrend, near the citadel of the Lich King.

Valea Twinblades was a human citizen of the traitorous kingdom of Alterac. She was a notable warrior specializing in dual-wielding swords. She was killed in the Eastern Plaguelands.

Yana Bloodspear, like Invar One-arm, was a human citizen of Dalaran. She was the second Chief Assassin of the Crusade. She was killed in Tirisfal Glades.

The ideals of the Scarlet creed can appeal to more than just humans. Those who lay down their lives for the Scarlet Crusade are honored, human or not. Non-human crusaders are few, but tend to be all the more zealous in order to prove themselves.

**Herod, the Scarlet Champion**, was always a brute. Even in his young days growing up in Southshore, he was known as a bully. He used those habits to improve his martial prowess and became influential in the Scarlet Crusade.

## Cathedral

The Cathedral wing first opens into the Chapel Gardens, where members wander, tend to the gardens, and meditate. The people here also serve as guards to the Cathedral itself, where the leadership of the Monastery reside.

Hidden away in a secret chamber is the undead corpse of **High Inquisitor Fairbanks**. It is unknown why the Scarlet Crusade kept him here, and really, it’s odd that we’d fight him. He’s a good guy!

He’s the one that saw the truth of the events of the corruption of the Ashbringer: when Renault Mograine picked up the holy sword and stabbed his father with it. When Fairbanks told the people of the Monastery of this, he was killed for spouting heresy.

While there were many factors involving the creation of the Scarlet Crusade and the Argent Dawn, Fairbanks’ death was where the line was finally crossed and the factions split.

Should anyone ever bring the Corrupted Ashbringer to Fairbanks, he hints at reforging a new Ashbringer in the Outlands, but nothing ever came of it.

**Scarlet Commander Renault Mograine** is the son of Highlord Alexandros Mograine – the Ashbringer. It was he who picked up the legendary sword and corrupted it with his act of betrayal by killing his father.

He did so because he felt like he was overshadowed by his father’s legendary title and deeds, and that if he was out of the picture, he himself could attain greatness, power, and prestige. That ambition carries over to his leadership in the Monastery.

The treachery was not forgotten. Alexandros Mograine, wielding the Corrupted Ashbringer, is now a death knight in service to the Scourge. If the unholy blade is brought here, the spirit of Alexandros will kill his son in retribution.

Ah, Sally Whitemane. Fan favorite and riser of many champions. **High Inquisitor Sally Whitemane** is a powerful priestess of the Light. She, along with Mograine, are the leaders of the Scarlet Monastery subset of the Scarlet Crusade.

Sally grew up in Southshore along with Renault, Jimmy Vishas, and Herod. All of them eventually became part of the Crusade together. Sally saw her family succumb to undeath, and she was forced to kill her undead parents and siblings.

This traumatic event led to a fanatical hatred of the undead, and that zealotry carried her well into the upper echelons of the Crusade. Her distaste for undeath was so extreme that she became extremely proficient in resurrection as a way to combat it.

In an ironic twist of fate, in the future she will be raised in undeath to become a member of the Four Horsemen as a death knight in service to the Lich King.

![Uldaman](https://i.imgur.com/YyG9QSR.jpg)

## Dungeon History

When the world was created, legends say the Titans created the mortal races. They made the troggs from stone, but deemed the troggs an experimental failure and locked them away deep within the earth.

They then tried again, creating a new race out of stone – and what resulted were the Earthen, the predecessors to the dwarves. At least, that is what we know of so far. The truth may be held within the Titan vault known as Uldaman.

In the future, we came to know that the Titans created the Mechagnomes and the Earthen out of metal and stone respectively, and it was through the Old Gods’ influence in the Curse of Flesh to weaken their bodies that the gnomes and dwarves emerged.

Uldaman is a series of Earthen facilities buried within the mountain range of Khaz Modan. While the dwarven Explorer’s League discovered it prior to the Third War, they had to abandon their excavations in order to assist in the war effort.

After the tunnels and structures were vacated, troggs and Dark Iron dwarves moved in. The Dark Irons presumably wish to claim Uldaman’s secrets for themselves. The Titans have left guardians of stone to protect Uldaman from those who would plunder it.

The Horde may wonder; this is an Alliance-centric place. Why should we be here? The answer is simple: treasure. We are here not for its secrets, but for finding ancient artifacts of power and looting the corpses of those who have died searching for them.

## Bosses and Encounters

**Revelosh** is fascinated with titan artifacts and picks up any that he finds. Some may consider him a trogg equivalent to an archaeologist, but since he does not treat his possessions with respect, he is more akin to a treasure-hunting thief.

These unfortunate Remains of a Paladin are all that are left from an anonymous paladin of the Alliance that purchased a custom-made necklace from the gnome Talvash del Kissel in Ironforge. He uses magic to enchant his wares.

Talvash was a jeweler of great renown, but after the death of this paladin, a competitor spread the rumor that he sells cursed jewelry. His sales plummeted. It’s just a rumor, though, so now Horde and Alliance are after this valuable necklace.

These lost dwarves took on a contract with the Explorer’s League to clear a path for a group of researchers, but ended up getting lost in the maze of tunnels.

**Baelog** is the fighter, the specialist in combat. **Eric “The Swift”** always favored speed and charging forward. **Olaf** preferred his shield, and could use it as a parachute. They’re a reference to Blizzard’s old game, The Lost Vikings.

**Ironaya** is a Titanic Watcher that oversaw the construction and maintenance of Uldaman. She has spent millennia in stasis, constantly analyzing the condition of the structure and figuring out a way to restore it to its original state.

When the Old God Yogg-Saron began spreading his corrupting influence, Archaedas and Ironaya stole the Discs of Norgannon from Ulduar and fled here. They took mechagnomes and earthen with them to help craft a vault to protect the Discs.

This event ended up “seeding” the Eastern Kingdom with the gnomes and dwarves as the Curse of Flesh spread among them. In a sense, Uldaman is an ancestral home to these races.

The **Obsidian Sentinel** is one of the many ancient guardians of Uldaman, but has been corrupted by an unknown force. It seems capable of reflecting magic cast at it.

When considering this, along with the capabilities of the obsidian destroyers employed by the Scourge and the Qiraji, it appears as though obsidian has unique properties and interactions with mana and magic in general. Curious indeed…

This **Ancient Stone Keeper** is a golem that staffed and operated the Titan Vault, and acted as the intermediary between the Watchers in control of the facility and their servants. He now stands as the last of his kind.

Annora is the only Artisan enchanting trainer in Azeroth. Not sure why she’s in Uldaman, but judging by her clothing she’s the adventuring type. She’s rather cautious, or afraid of scorpids, because she won’t speak with us unless we clear them out.

**Galgann Firehammer** is delving into Uldaman to secure the secrets of this place for the Dark Irons. He is a senator from Shadowforge City, sent to find any artifacts of considerable power that Emperor Thaurissan can use against their foes.

Usually, in trogg society, the biggest and strongest trogg is becomes chieftain of the tribe. **Grimlok**, however, became chieftain through clever intimidation. He trained a basilisk as a pet, and threatened any who opposed his rule with petrification.

The Titan of Celestial Magic and Lore, Norgannon, created **Archaedas** the Watcher from the oldest, strongest stone. He serves as the most powerful guardian to the Discs of Norgannon locked deep in the Titan Vault.

Archaedas was entrusted by the Titans to lead the titan-forged armies against the forces of the Old Gods, but he eventually fled with Ironaya and the Discs of Norgannon when the Old God corruption spread too far.

The Discs of Norgannon themselves are a wondrous artifact. They are a library of Azeroth’s entire history, and new information continues to be recorded within them as they happen. Thanks to our efforts, a miniature copy will be taken to Thunder Bluff. / Ironforge.

![ZulFarrak](https://i.imgur.com/cqfvTAD.jpg)

## Dungeon History

Tanaris was once a jungle, and part of the vast territories of the Gurubashi Empire. The Farraki tribe of trolls, allied with the Gurubashi, established their capital city of Zul’Farrak in the jungles of Tanaris.

You’ll come to find that as a common naming scheme for troll cities. The Farraki in the southwest made Zul’Farrak. The Gurubashi in the southeast made Zul’Gurub. The Amani in the northeast made Zul’Aman. The Drakkari in the north made Zul’Drak.

When the Sundering occurred and split the continents, the landscape changed drastically. The climate changed, and the humidity of the jungle gave way to the arid heat of a dry desert. The sands devoured the other troll settlements.

The trolls themselves, however, are a remarkably resilient species. The Farraki adapted to a desert-dwelling lifestyle, unofficially being called the “Sandfury tribe”.

Since they lost so much of their territory to the desert, the sand trolls now fiercely defend their land from outsiders.

Long ago, the Farraki participated in the troll wars against the Qiraji. Such grand battles earned them great honors, though that does not mean much anymore with their hostile territorial habits.

With the harsh environment and reclusive lifestyle, it is difficult for the Farraki tribe to survive. In especially desperate times, they often resort to voodoo-based necromancy to assist in day-to-day life.

Because of this, the loa Bwonsamdi does not watch over the souls of dead Farraki. Lacking his protection in death, the sand trolls must watch over their own.

## Bosses and Encounters

There is nothing to say of the rare **_Sandarr Dunereaver_**. Have at him!

It is rare to find **_Zerilis_** walking around, but there is not much to say of him.

Many years ago, **Theka the Martyr** was killed in combat in the war between the qiraji and the trolls. It was because of his sacrifice that Zul’Farrak still stands. As such, he is considered the greatest Farraki hero who ever lived.

The Farraki raised him undeath so that he can maintain a vigil of guardianship over his beloved city. It is a favored legend among the trolls that the qiraji that killed him were cursed into being the mindless scarabs beneath his feet.

**Antu’sul** treats his precious sul’lithuz basilisks as if they were his own children. He reacts violently to anyone who harms them, even fellow trolls. He lets his basilisks feed on the corpses of his victims to ensure they remain strong and ruthless.

**Witch Doctor Zum’rah** presides over life and death for the sand trolls. As you can see, the Farraki bury their dead here, but in times of need, Zum’rah uses voodoo to call upon them as necessary. The sandfury trolls know no rest, even in death.

The **_Dustwraith_** can sometimes be found here, but he offers no lore.

There’s nothing notable of the **Sandfury Executioner**; he’s just in the way of us meeting **Sergeant Bly’s party**. There isn’t much in the way of lore for them, other than that they’re kind of a scrappy bunch and a little untrustworthy.

If they survive and are left alone long enough, they will hearthstone out of the dungeon. I suppose they thought it was too risky to use while they were under the watch of the executioner.

**Shadowpriest Sezz’ziz** is likely an important religious leader to the Farraki trolls, and he assists the undead **Nekrum Gutchewer** maintain his decaying body. The two are a team that gather sacrifices to feed their god, Gahz’rilla.

**Chief Ukorz Sandscalp** grew up on tales of the ancient times where trolls ruled the ancient lands as the dominant race on Azeroth. He dreams of returning the troll empires to those glory days without outsider influence.

He relies on his trusted assistant Ruuzlu to help him achieve his goal the only way he knows how, with violence.

In the future, a new tribe of sand trolls will emerge, the Sandscalp trolls. Whether they are related to Ukorz is unknown.

**Ruuzlu** himself helps Chief Ukorz with his plans on retaking Tanaris for the Farraki. The plans to use scarabs, sul’lithuz basilisks, and troll zombies were his idea.

**Hydromancer Velratha** holds power over one of the most precious substances in Farraki society: water. She also oversees the secret rituals to assist in the revival of their god Gahz’rilla.

However, unlike her reclusive brethren, she has travelled the world to collect knowledge and artifacts in order to gain the powers that she has. This makes her somewhat of an outcast among her kind. She believes her efforts are justified.

Her sister, Kulratha, is also a Hydromancer, and takes over her duties after Velratha is killed. Kulratha has ties to Cho’gall of the Twilight’s Hammer cult. At his behest, she tries to summon Gahz’rilla to Stormwind and Thunder Bluff.

**Gahz’rilla** is worshipped by the trolls as a god. They carve its image on their walls and into figurines. The pool from which it is summoned is considered the holiest place for all the Farraki. Its gender is unknown, as multiple sources conflict.

In truth, it’s likely a favored pet of the Old Gods, much like Aku’mai of Blackfathom Deeps, or maybe it’s a nature spirit of Azeroth. Either way, they’ve been gathering sacrifices to sate its hunger, as they fear it just as much as they revere it.

## Dungeon History

Cenarius, demigod of nature and Forest Lord, had three notable sons. Keeper Remulos is the guardian and lord of Moonglade. Keeper Ordanus lives in Raynewood Retreat in Ashenvale helping the night elves; making him an assassination target for the Horde.

Our focus today is on the third son, the eldest, Keeper Zaetar. Where Remulos was strong and beautiful, Zaetar was slender and cunning. While Cenarius respected them both, Zaetar could not help but feel like he could not compare to his brother.

When Remulos bore children such as Celebras and his dryad sisters, a jealous Zaetar looked to outdo his brother in any way he could.

The other half of this story, Princess Theradras, is a powerful earth elemental and daughter of the Elemental Lord of Earth, Therazane. Unlike other elementals, she escaped the shackles of the titans by hiding away beneath the earth.

1,100 years ago, the ancient tauren shamans heard her speak through the ground. Mistaking her faint whispers for their benevolent deity, the Earth Mother, the shamans called back to Theradras, which awakened her from hiding.

She erupted from the ground in a weakened state. She called out to the land around her to give her strength. The fertile grasslands of Mashan’she was immediately transformed into a barren desert… soon to be called Desolace by the horrified tauren.

Keeper Zaetar felt the ripples of this immense loss of life through the Emerald Dream and came to investigate. As his eyes beheld Princess Theradras, however, he was not angered, but instead fell in love. From their union came the centaur.

The centaur, unlike the Keepers, are a brutal, savage race. They saw the disgust in Zaetar’s eyes and killed their own father. Theradras, heartbroken by her children’s actions, chastised the centaur and sent them away.

From there, the centaur named the area Maraudon and proclaimed their birthplace as holy ground to be defended at all costs. Princess Theradras buried her beloved Zaetar within the deepest part of her lair.

Worried that recent events with the Horde, the Alliance, and the Burning Legion pose a threat to her children, Theradras infused the centaur with additional earthen power and commanded them to claim new territory outside of Desolace.

## Purple Wing (Wicked Grotto)

**Lord Vyletongue** is the head of the Putridus clan of satyrs and journeyed to Maraudon after hearing of its corruption.

Theradras was wary of the demon, so he created and gifted Noxxion and Razorlash to her as minions. He promised that they could protect her domain. This was just a ruse to gain her trust so that he could speed the corruption of the area.

**Tinkerer Gizlock** was part of a team of six gem hunters seeking to find the rumored crystal garden found here. The plan went awry when satyrs appeared and killed nearly everyone. Now, Gizlock hides here in the caverns in a maddened state.

**_Meshlok the Harvester_** is rarely seen wandering these parts, but he offers nothing in the way of lore.

## Orange Wing (Foulspore Cavern)

**Noxxion** was created by Lord Vyletongue as a living embodiment of corruption. It spreads its toxic essence around Maraudon by his command. Otherwise, it serves as a powerful servant to Theradras and soothes her loneliness.

**Razorlash** was grown to assist Noxxion in its efforts to shred and toxify the plant life of Maraudon. It, alongside Noxxion, has become one of Theradras’ favorite servants.

## Poison Falls

Celebras is the son of Remulos, the lord of Moonglade. It was his birth that sparked Zaetar’s jealousy and had him look for a mate that ultimately led to the creation of the centaur.

Celebras heard of his uncle’s fate, so he and a few of his sisters entered Maraudon to free his spirit. They were unprepared for the level of corruption here, and so it swiftly overtook them. His heart swelled with rage at his own fate.

## Pristine Waters

Mountain giants were created by the Titans the protect the environment. They are benevolent by nature. **Landslide** here spent his innumerable days cultivating the crystal gardens, but Theradras took control of him when she took over the area.

The famed dwarven hunter Hemet Nesingwary once hunted the ancient crocolisk **Rotgrip**, but eventually proclaimed that the beast could not be found. Amateur trackers often take up the challenge, but none ever return.

Rumor says that Rotgrip has lived in the waters of Maraudon for millennia.

**Princess Theradras**, daughter to the Elemental Lord Therazane the Stonemother, is cause of all of this suffering. She imprisoned the soul of her lover, Keeper Zaetar. Why would an elemental embrace all of this toxicity and decay among her home?

The reason for her madness is from her long slumber beneath the earth, hiding from the Titans’ imprisonment. Deep underground, she was touched by the Old Gods and became a new vector for their brand of chaos and corruption.

Therazane will not take kindly to us killing her daughter.

![Sunken Temple](https://i.imgur.com/pp1wipB.jpg)

## Dungeon History

1,500 years ago, an influential group of priests in the Gurubashi Empire summoned forth the avatar of the blood god, Hakkar the Soulflayer. They called themselves the Hakkari. Many converts joined the fold.

In light of this newfound power, the Gurubashi began conquering vast swaths of land, destroying all who stood in their way. The Zandalari tribe recognized the eventual threat they posed: Hakkar was consuming all without rest. He would not stop.

The Zandalari met with Gurubashi rebels who were unhappy with Hakkar’s control of the tribe. They learned of the Atal’ai: Hakkar’s most zealous priests. They were planning to summon Hakkar’s body fully into the world, which would doom the planet.

Horrified, the Zandalari and Gurubashi rebels attacked Zul’Gurub and successfully defeated Hakkar’s avatar and most of his followers. However, some of the Atal’ai priests escaped the attack and fled north into the Swamp of Sorrows.

They built a new structure, the Temple of Atal’Hakkar, to continue their worship and eventually resume their plans. They did not forget their loss, and vowed to get revenge on the Zandalari. They practiced their rituals in secret.

“Atal’Hakkar” means “Devoted to Hakkar” or “In Honor of Hakkar” in the troll language Zandali.

However, their dark magic seeped into the swamp and twisted the plants and wildlife around the temple, which attracted the green dragon aspect, Ysera. She unleashed her power upon the temple, destroying its foundations and sinking it into the swamp.

Ysera then ordered her green dragons to guard this new Sunken Temple to ensure that any rituals to summon Hakkar would never happen again. And yet, her plan backfired: the sunken nature of the temple ensured that the Atal’ai could act undisturbed.

The dark energies within the temple twisted the green dragons’ connection to the Emerald Dream, locking them in a permanent Nightmare. They now lash out at anything nearby in a fit of madness.

## Temple Basement

It’s rare to see the **_Spawn of Hakkar_**, but it’s unknown whether it’s the actual progeny of Hakkar. Better to take care of it just in case.

**Atal’alarion** is the sworn protector of the Idol of Hakkar here in the Temple Basement. I don’t know why he was banished behind these statue activations, but it’s likely related to his extreme bloodthirst. It might have risked their subtle ways.

Druids need a putrid vine from Atal’alarion to create a toxin on behalf of a hunter in Un’goro. He wishes to pacify the Devilsaurs so that he may hunt more peacefully to survive.

## Main Temple

**Zul’Lor** the two-handed warrior, **Gasher** the dual-wielding warrior, **Loro** the shielded warrior, **Zolo** the shaman, **Mijan** the healer, and **Hukku** the warlock are all Atal’ai that sustain the magic barrier that protect Jammal’an the Prophet.

Warriors are tasked by the ghost of the Fallen Hero of the Horde to retrieve the voodoo feathers of the Atal’ai. He can use the feathers to reform his body long enough to grant the warrior a piece of his old gear as a reward for fighting on his behalf.

Paladins come here to pick up voodoo feathers from these Atal’ai to fuse with a sanctified scourgestone to create an item called a mightstone: a minor artifact capable of strengthening the user and damaging the undead.

Shamans want to collect voodoo feathers to help a troll hermit in Hillsbrad sleep better at night because he disturbed the elements. Warriors might remember him; he’s the troll that summoned the Cyclonian elemental for their Whirlwind weapon.

Warlocks take the voodoo feathers as a gift to Impsy the imp in Felwood. He’s jealous that warlocks get pets, so he wants a pet of his own. He’s making a stuffed minion out of felcloth, using the voodoo feathers to fluff it up until it’s huggable.

It’s rather remarkable how unremarkable **_Kazkaz the Unholy_** is for being a rare sight. He doesn’t even have a rare loot table.

**Jammal’an the Prophet** is the current leader of the Atal’ai, the extremist sect of the Hakkari. During his deep meditations, he learned of a way to resurrect Hakkar by using the blood of the green dragonflight.

He is ready to do anything to succeed in his goal of resurrecting Hakkar, but seems unaware that his actions seem to also be spreading the effects of the Emerald Nightmare. Not that he would care, should his plan come to fruition.

**Ogom the Wretched** is an assistant to Jammal’an the Prophet, and little more.

When Eranikus came to the Sunken Temple, he brought four young, strong, and eager drakes with him: **Dreamscythe**, **Weaver**, **Hazzas**, and **Morphaz**. These Wardens of the Dream are half-crazed from the Emerald Nightmare.

Morphaz seems to be a celebrity of sorts. Mages are sent to kill him by Archmage Xylem in Azshara. Morphaz devoured one of Xylem’s apprentices while they were holding a large arcane shard. He wants the shard back.

Rogues are on a mission from Ravenholdt Manor to open a magically-sealed bag. Our friend, Azshara’s Archmage Xylem is removing the magic seal of the bag, but sends rogues to fetch the key. Morphaz, for whatever reason, holds the key to the bag.

Priests have learned that he is immune to all forms of poison and disease. They are here on behalf of the Cenarion Circle in Azshara to gather his blood to help create a cure to fight the blight of Felwood.

Hunters want to kill him to collect his tooth as a hunting trophy and prove their hunting skills to an old hunter in Azshara. Wait a minute, all these Morphaz hits are from Azshara! Coincidence, or did Morphaz do something there to get their attention?

**Eranikus** is a former consort to Ysera the Dreamer, the aspect of the green dragonflight. He was stationed here to prevent Hakkar’s emergence, but the harsh energies here have pulled him in two.

This Shade of Eranikus only half-exists here in the physical plane, and the other half exists within the Emerald Nightmare.

What is the Emerald Nightmare? The Emerald Dream is a spiritual world that is a mirror to our own. Nature exists in its most wild form there, and the rules of time and space are fluid. The Nightmare is the Old God’s influence upon the Emerald Dream.

Don’t expect Eranikus’ quest here to finish properly. It ends abruptly without a conclusion. Instead, it continues on in the long quest chain of the Scepter of the Shifting Sands, to open the gates of Ahn’Qiraj. Within it, Eranikus will be cleansed.

The **Avatar of Hakkar** is the immortal presence of the troll god, Hakkar himself. This skeletal version is a premature summoning, leaving him in a severely weakened state. While we can defeat him here, it is a hollow victory. He will be back.

Hakkar was never meant to be summoned here in the Temple of Atal’Hakkar. His true summoning location is, and always had to be, the Gurubashi capital: Zul’Gurub.

![Blackrock Depths](https://i.imgur.com/Wde5E9a.jpg)

## Dungeon History

Around 250 years ago, the three rival dwarf clans – Bronzebeard, Wildhammer, and Dark Iron – fought for control of Ironforge. The Bronzebeards were ultimately successful and drove the other two out of the city. The Wildhammers moved to Grim Batol.

The Dark Irons settled in the peaceful Redridge Mountains, but they sought revenge for their defeat. Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan wanted to claim all of Khaz Modan for the Dark Irons, and planned a two-pronged attack upon the two other dwarf clans.

Thaurissan assaulted Ironforge while his wife Modgud attacked Grim Batol. The sieges were short-lived: the Bronzebeards and the Wildhammers pushed back harder than expected, and Modgud was killed in the counterattack.

With the two opposing clans pushing into Redridge and with the death of his wife, Thaurissan was cornered. In a last-ditch effort and in a fit of desperation, he used his sorcery to evoke a powerful fire spell to blast his enemies.

It did not go as expected. He mistakenly summoned Ragnaros, the Elemental Lord of Fire, instead. The surge of heat scorched the earth black, destroying everything in a wide berth and creating the Searing Gorge and Burning Steppes.

This monumental summoning killed Thaurissan. In the place where Ragnaros emerged now stands the volcano named Blackrock Mountain. Such was the end of the War of the Three Hammers: not with a whimper, but with a bang that shook the continent.

Ragnaros himself was weakened from the summoning, and retreated to the deepest part of the mountain, the Molten Core, to gather his strength. He enslaved the Dark Irons and ordered them occupy the Mountain and serve his will.

In the following years, the Dark Irons dug deep into the mountain, creating their new home and capital, Shadowforge City, in Blackrock Depths. From it, they utilize their namesake ore, Dark Iron, in their construction, arms, and armor.

## Bosses and Encounters

**High Interrogator Gerstahn** is a Twilight’s Hammer cultist and emissary, and loves to indulge in the finer things in life: exotic foods, fine clothing, and gem-encrusted torture tools. Her favorite sound is the cries of her torture victims.

Kharan Mighthammer was assigned to escort Princess Moira from Ironforge to Lakeshire to discuss plans on how to defend against Blackrock orc incursions. He and the princess were captured while the rest of the guard were killed.

He is suspicious of the event, thinking that the Dark Irons knew that the escort was coming, but he doesn’t know who the traitor was that gave away their position. He’s frustrated at his failure in the mission.

Marshal Reginald Windsor is a highly-respected Stormwind commander who was stationed in the Burning Steppes to investigate the Dark Horde and Lady Katrana Prestor’s possible treachery to the throne.

He is the rightful wielder of the sacred dwarven artifact weapon, Ironfoe. It was given to his great, great grandfather, and Windsor inherited it by birthright. When he was captured by the Dark Irons during his investigations, it was taken from him.

Commander Gor’shak is one of Thrall’s operatives who intentionally got himself captured to spy on the Dark Irons. He tasks members of the Horde to cooperate with Kharan Mighthammer.

On Thrall’s orders, the Horde are tasked with ensuring Princess Moira Bronzebeard’s safe return to Ironforge to strengthen the bond between the Horde and the Alliance.

**Houndmaster Grebmar Fleabeard** is an orphan who started breeding canines to serve as companions and guard dogs. His beasts are the only family he’s ever known. He likes to treat them with Dark Iron ale from the Grim Guzzler.

**Lord Roccor** is a rather clever lava elemental. He hates the constant scheming and backstabbing that fire elementals often partake in, so to avoid dealing with his own kind, he purposefully angered Ragnaros the Firelord.

That risky gambit paid off. Instead of being destroyed, he was instead banished from the Molten Core and forced to guard Blackrock Depths in peaceful isolation. I rather like this guy.

The **Ring of Law** is one of the favored pastimes of the Dark Irons. Criminals are cast into the arena and pitted against savage creatures gathered from across Azeroth. **High Justice Grimstone** serves as the Ring’s announcer.

Despite the flashy event, the normal minibosses here don’t have any special lore about them. However, with the Banner of Provocation, we can summon the ex-mercenary **Theldren** of the Veiled Blade. He doesn’t fight fair, but he can’t turn down a fight.

The shaman **Pyromancer Loregrain** is another Twilight Hammer cultist among Blackrock Depths. He was once a respected member of the Earthen Ring, but left for mysterious reasons. He has a strange obsession with Franclorn F. Forgewright.

Loregrain kneels before the monument to Franclorn, the architect of most of the Depths as well as the Stonewrought Dam in Loch Modan, effectively creating the Loch and the Wetlands. Franclorn also forged the twin hammers Ironfoe and Ironfel.

The great Franclorn hated to see his race enslaved and put to evil purposes, and lost his will to live. His tomb lies in the center of Blackrock Mountain, in the rock hanging from the chains. His spirit hungers for justice.

**Lord Incendius** was personally taught by the elemental lieutenant Baron Geddon. Geddon was surprised at Incendius’ destructive power, and became wary that he may surpass him. He sent Incendius to guard the Black Anvil to stunt his fast-growing potential.

The **Dark Keepers Zimrel Darktooth**, **Pelver Deepstomp**, **Bethek Stormbrow**, **Uggel Hammerhand**, **Ofgut Stonefist**, and **Vorfalk Irongourd** have no particular lore about them; they simply keep the key to the Dark Coffer in the Black Vault.

The mage **Warder Stilgiss** was entrusted to protect the Dark Iron Black Vault after years of dedication to Emperor Dagran Thaurissan. His friend, Houndmaster Grebmar, gifted him Verek as congratulations for his prestigious new position.

**Verek** is put to great use as a guard dog for the Black Vault, and has scared off many would-be thieves.

**Watchman Doomgrip** is nothing special; merely a guardsman for the Vault.

The Chief Architect of Blackrock Depths, Franclorn Forgewright, was a good man. When he passed away, **Fineous Darkvire** replaced him as the new Chief. Fineous has no respect for Franclorn’s designs and uses Franclorn’s cherished weapon, Ironfel.

He plotted and schemed to get his position by passing off the ideas of more gifted masons as his own. His dark desires and evil deeds has provoked the spirit of the righteous Franclorn from beyond the grave.

Unfortunately, this was all a deception. Fineous’s daughter, Fenella Darkvire did all those dark acts under Fineous’ name. Unwilling to expose her conniving deeds, Fineous played along and tarnished his own reputation to preserve his daughter’s.

Thus, he is marked for death just for protecting his daughter. After his murder, Fenella feels no remorse, and continues her life of falsehoods to improve her standing, eventually becoming the premier architect of the Dark Irons.

Ragnaros himself pulled **Bael’Gar** the molten giant out of the Firelands, the elemental plane of fire. He serves one purpose: to guard the gate here.

The venerable **General Angerforge** has spent his entire lifetime studying dwarven military history and tactics. His loyalty to the Dark Iron clan is resolute, and he is more than willing to die protecting his people.

He recently angered Emperor Dagran Thaurissan for writing a treatise on the Dark Iron’s past military failures. A foolish error on the Emperor’s part; by refusing the acknowledge the mistakes of the past, he cannot learn to avoid them in the future.

**Golem Lord Argelmach** toils here, obsessed with the idea of immortality. He repeatedly forges enchanted constructs in his own image. Other Dark Irons whisper that he dabbles in black magic to enshrine his soul in a golem should his body be destroyed.

**Hurley Blackbreath** is not so much a regular at the Grim Guzzler – he lives here. In the past ten years, he left the bar only once to steal the recipe for Thunderbrew Lager. He sometimes brews it to give him strength and courage… if he’s sober.

After the fall of Gnomeregan, the leper gnome **Plugger Spazzring** came to Shadowforge City to carve out a new life. He serves as the barkeep and owner of the Grim Guzzler tavern. He works hard to maintain a pleasant atmosphere and sense of camaraderie.

Since Gnomeregan fell less than 4 years ago and the Grim Guzzler has been around for at least a decade, we can assume Plugger bought the establishment from a previous owner. He makes ludicrous profit here, so he made a good deal.

Plugger Spazzring is a warlock, and Mistress Nagmara is his succubus minion. She doesn’t mind serving as the Grim Guzzler barmaid. She’s in love with one of the patrons, Private Rocknot, and is willing to use a love potion to get what she wants.

Her name, Nagmara, is an anagram for “anagram”.

Drunken brawls used to be a daily occurrence at the Grim Guzzler until Plugger Spazzring installed **Phalanx** as a bouncer. He was programmed to maintain peace and order, and will use extreme force if necessary.

**Ribbly Screwspigot** is something of a screw-up. He has a habit of borrowing money and squandering it on get-rich-quick schemes. He’s on the hit list for Booty Bay’s kingpin, Baron Revilgaz, after his latest failure, “Ribbly’s Chewable Gunpowder”.

His family members are glad to hear of the bounty, because that finally meant he was worth something. Ribbly, understandably, fled here to the Grim Guzzler to evade any bounty hunters.

Lokhtos Darkbargainer is a member of the Thorium Brotherhood, a company of Dark Irons that escaped the enslavement of Ragnaros. After the War of the Three Hammers, the Thorium Brotherhood ran from Blackrock Mountain, but Lokhtos was old and stayed behind.

He didn’t want to slow his compatriots and doom them to Ragnaros’ fury. He instead hid among the enslaved Dark Irons, keeping his true allegiance secret. Despite his trapped state in Blackrock, he remains in high regard among the Thorium Brotherhood.

The Thorium Brotherhood is the clan that best know the true secrets of forging Dark Iron and Sulfuron arms and armor. They are among the best blacksmiths on Azeroth.

**Ambassador Flamelash** serves as the Molten Core ambassador to the Dark Irons. While he hated the dwarves at first, he slowly grew to appreciate their capability for violence and destruction.

He guards the Chamber of Enchantment, which the Dark Irons use to empower their weapons and armor.

There isn’t anything particularly notable about _**Panzor the Invincible**_. His title is clearly just for show.

**The Seven** are the spirits of the Dark Iron dwarves of great knowledge and power during the War of the Three Hammers. They were the ones who, centuries ago, directly assisted Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan in summoning Ragnaros the Firelord.

Though they, along with Thaurissan, were killed in the summoning, their spirits remain here, bound to serve their elemental master. They seem to view Ragnaros’s summoning as a blessing, and are not aware of his enslavement of their race.

**Doom’rel** serves as the leader of the Seven. **Gloom’rel** knows the secrets of the Dark Iron ore, and is willing to share it if given proper tribute. The others jeer at us with menacing threats.

Dark Iron Emperor Dagran Thaurissan is fearful of assassins. Ambassador Flamelash stationed **Magmus** here to guard the Emperor’s royal chambers. Not satisfied, Dagran granted Magmus control over the fire-breathing statues to assist in the defense.

**Emperor Dagran Thaurissan** is a direct descendant of Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan, who summoned Ragnaros centuries ago. While he delights in the power bestowed upon him by the Firelord, he hides his misgivings about being chained in servitude to him.

Like his ancestor, he dreams of conquering the other dwarf clans. He seeks to rule over them, but also wishes to use the combined might of the dwarves to break the Dark Irons free from Ragnaros’ control.

He kidnapped Princess Moira Bronzebeard as a hostage. However, he fell in love with her upon seeing her sharp wit and strong will. Moira in turn fell in love with Dagran after receiving his affections and seeing his noble intentions in freeing his clan.

He wields the sacred hammer Ironfoe, forged by the legendary architect Franclorn Forgewright, and taken by the rightful wielder Marshal Windsor after his capture.

**Moira Bronzebeard** is the Crown Princess of Ironforge, but is now co-ruler of Shadowforge City after falling in love with Dagran Thaurissan. People wonder if it is true love, or if the Emperor ensorcelled her.

Seeing as how she remains true to him after death, it is likely the former. She is also pregnant with his child, which calls into question how Ironforge will respond to a Dark Iron having a legitimate claim to the throne.

![Dire Maul](https://i.imgur.com/ADMId09.jpg)

## Dungeon History

12,000 years ago, the city of Eldre’Thalas was built by night elven sorcerers to protect Queen Azshara’s arcane secrets. It is a marvel how much of the structure still stands after so many years, even after the Sundering that tore the world apart.

It is no surprise, however, that the highborne no longer rule over this place. Instead, ogres, satyrs, entities demonic and arcane, as well as the ghosts of the past dwell here. The place has a new name: Dire Maul.

The arena in the center of Dire Maul features free-for-all gladiatorial combat. Throwing captives in to fight to the death is one of the ogres’ favored pastimes.

The Crimson Ring is an underground network of cheats, gamblers, and other ne’er-do-wells who organize underground combat tournaments. Once a year, they host one here in the arena of Dire Maul.

The next Crimson Ring tournament will be won by Rehgar Earthfury, whose team consists of an amnesiac King Varian Wrynn of Stormwind, the night elven druid Broll Bearmantle, and the blood elven rogue, Valeera Sanguinar.

## Dire Maul West

**Tendris Warpwood** spent his entire life defending the city of Eldre’Thalas, as his wooden heart is tied to the fate of the city. His resolve never wavered even as the Sundering shattered the land, but his spirit has weakened as corruption slowly spread.

The Shen’dralar Ancient is a spirit that tells the tale of what happened here. Much like what I’m doing, but with a bit less detail. Consider hers an abridged version.

**Illyanna Ravenoak** was once Prince Tortheldrin’s most valued hunter, but he slew her when she refused his order to kill her friends. As punishment, he bound her spirit to her body to serve as an undead protector to Dire Maul.

**Ferra** is Ilyanna’s faithful companion, in life and in undeath. She shares Illyanna’s grisly fate as unwilling guardian of this place.

When Prince Tortheldrin gave the order to slaughter the majority of his subjects, only his most loyal carried out his command. **Magister Kalendris** murdered many Shen’dralar without hesitation, but one doomed elf mortally wounded him in defiance.

Even in death, Kalendris roams Dire Maul in perfect servitude to his master.

**_Tsu’zee_** has nothing to offer in terms of lore. She is merely a rare sight in Dire Maul.

After the destruction of the Well of Eternity, many Highborne became desperate for sources of magic to replace it. The elves summoned **Immol’thar** the void terror and imprisoned him here, siphoning his power to replenish their own.

Over the millennia, the crystal pylons that bind Immol’thar have weakened, and the demon is eager to break free and rend the flesh of its captors.

This **Xorothian Dreadsteed** hails from another dimension in the Twisting Nether, the fiery plains of Xoroth. It takes materials from around the world to create the Circle of Greater Summoning, but in the end, it is worth it to bind it to a warlock’s will.

This Dreadsteed is stolen from **Lord Hel’nurath** the Nathrezim stablemaster, but since when have such things mattered? It’s not like we ever face consequences.

**Prince Tortheldrin** is the leader of the Shen’dralar and a loyal servant to Queen Azshara. He sought to protect the highborne of this city, so when they began starving for magic, he ordered the creation of the crystal pylons to capture a demon.

When the demon Immol’thar was captured and they successfully began siphoning power from it, all seemed well at first. They had a limitless source of energy… but it was tainted, and it warped the prince’s mind.

Eventually it made him paranoid, and the pylons themselves began to weaken. To conserve power, he ordered his most fanatical servants to kill off most of his subjects, so that only the most powerful and loyal would remain.

After the Prince is deposed, he will be replaced with Mordent Evenshade. The Shen’dralar will join the Alliance and train the night elves in their long-forgotten art of being a mage.

Falrin Treeshaper lost his brother to the ogres and would love to see them all wiped out. He assists in the creation and enchantment of a Banner of Provocation for the Ring of Law in Blackrock Depths.

These Skeletal Remains of Master Kariel Winthalus are all that’s left of the blood elf loremaster. He was incinerated by Prince Tortheldrin while trying to gain ancient Shen’dralar secrets.

He fled to Kalimdor after Prince Kael’thas pledged his allegiance to Illidan Stormrage. He wrote a few of the Librams that we turn in here.

Lorekeeper Lydros is a loremaster with over ten thousand years of gathered knowledge. He had a short connection with Kariel Winthalus, but more importantly, he can interpret information from Librams, including \[Foror’s Compendium of Dragon Slaying\].

He can also teach mages how to conjure high levels of water.

Most of the other Lorekeepers are here to assist with bookkeeping. They make various remarks about how the books repeatedly get stolen, however, a magical mark of the Athenaeum prevents unauthorized reading, so the theft isn’t too useful.

These Shen’dralar Zealots keep talking about how the Prince knows about the Ashbringer, but nothing ever comes of it. It didn’t stop a flood of rumors and testing back in the vanilla days, though.

## Dire Maul East

**Pusillin** stole Elder Azj’Tordin’s book of incantations and the key to Dire Maul as he was escaping from the Athenaeum. He has a habit of running away. His name is derived from “pusillanimous”, meaning cowardly.

Since Zevrim Thornhoof wasn’t strong enough to control the Ancients, he tried controlling the elementals. **Hydrospawn** was initially a docile water elemental that grew agitated and restless at Zevrim’s profane rituals of control.

Hydrospawn eventually started retaliating against Zevrim’s minions. But over the years of lashing out at the demons, Zevrim’s leash tightened and the water elemental became bound to the demon’s will.

The satyr **Zevrim Thornhoof** told his masters in the Burning Legion that he could enslave the tree ancients that roam Dire Maul in a desperate bid to prove his worth. Since he is too weak to do so, he steals life energy from others to strengthen himself.

Like many blood elves, **Lethtendris** sought sources of magic to sate her magic addiction. She came to Dire Maul sensing its font of arcane energy.

She uses sinews and ligaments from sacrificial victims to construct a web that can siphon power from the area. Her morbid creation can store a large amount of destructive power. Both the Horde and the Alliance are wary of the danger of Lethtendris’ Web.

As Lethtendris is a warlock, **Pimgib** is her imp companion. Strangely, he is classified as a humanoid instead of a demon. His name is an anagram of bigimp, and, well, he is a big imp. Lethtendris sometimes makes him bigger in combat.

Old Ironbark is an Ancient of War that Zevrim Thornhoof held control over once he stole enough vitality from other living creatures. With Zevrim gone, Ironbark the Redeemed can once again serve the greater good and point us in the right direction.

**Alzzin the Wildshaper** lives to see the total corruption of Feralas. From the Shrine of Eldretharr, he enslaved the Ancients here and began manipulating the vitality of the forest directly, spreading the corruption as only a satyr of his caliber could.

Alzzin slew a night elven priest called **Isalien** and her pet hippogryph **Empyrean**, who were part of the mercenary company called the Veiled Blade. Isalien came here as part of a pilgrimage to learn of her heritage.

If we were properly prepared, we could use a Brazier of Beckoning to summon her and put her spirit to rest.

## Dire Maul North/Tribute

King Gordok once threw away an old pair of enchanted gauntlets. **Guard Mol’dar** found them and was convinced that it was a gift from the king personally meant for him.

He wore the gauntlets and became the Gordok arm wrestling champion for six years running. He credits the “gifted” enchanted gauntlets, unaware of their discarded nature. Because of his success, he became zealously loyal to the Gordok King.

The lovable **Stomper Kreeg** is never far from a drink. He is surprisingly perceptive, as he has detected many assassins that have crept through Dire Maul only to accidentally disturb one of his ale mugs, alerting him to their presence.

**Guard Fengus** spends every waking moment patrolling the halls of Dire Maul ever since the King’s assistant Cho’Rush the Observer told him he was destined to meet a mate while on duty. Actual prophecy, or clever manipulation? Hard to tell with an ogre.

Knot Thimblejack was captured by the Gordunni Ogres and is willing to deal with anyone to escape. He’s a perceptive craftsman, which leads to him telling potential saviors that violence is not always the answer – tributes can pay off just as well.

He was once mistakenly given blue glowing eyes, much like a Scourge death knight. That issue was fixed rather quickly.

**Guard Slip’kik** is plotting to kill King Gordok, but he’s lazy and cautious. He tinkers with traps and magical devices, hoping that one day the king will trip one and become an easy kill, making Slip’kik the King without risk or effort.

**Captain Kromcrush** is quick to anger and ruthlessly crushes dissent among his underlings. He does not tolerate insults to him or the king. He has a rather unfortunate rumor of an affair with a gnoll years ago, which torments him to this day.

There once was an ambitious ogre named Ulrok. He convinced a dozen ogres to attack the ogre king at once, which left nearly everyone involved dead or wounded. Ulrok killed everyone left and proclaimed himself **King Gordok**.

The Gordunni ogres who were unaware of the true happenings of the event merely spoke of it in hushed rumors as the “Day of Da Blood”. Such fear is why King Gordok remained in power for so long.

Otherwise, to become king of the ogres, one must simply proclaim themselves as such, and kill all those who disagree.

King Gordok has some ties to the quilboar crone Chugara Razorflank in Razorfen Kraul. He commissioned her powers in geomancy to reshape parts of Dire Maul to his liking.

**Cho’Rush the Observer** is a rather neutral ogre, preferring to assist whoever is in charge rather than taking sides whenever conflicts emerge. He will die for his king for as long as the king lives, but will stop hostilities if the king dies first.

He believes his two heads grants him an advantage over other ogres, as his two minds tend to agree with each other more often than not. This makes him more resourceful than most.

Mizzle the Crafty acts as a city crier of sorts, announcing news across Dire Maul as they occur. He also confirms events such as the death of a Gordunni King and identifies the successor.

## Dungeon History

While Lordaeron’s Capital City was the largest and most populous in the kingdom, Stratholme was the second. Its growth and prosperity were a shining example of human potential in the northern lands.

In the Second War, Archbishop Alonsus Faol founded the Knights of the Silver Hand in Stratholme as an act of desperation. The first paladins were mere clerics forced to pick up arms and armor, or knights ordered to read holy scripts.

They were made to combat the dark magic that the Old Horde used to great effect. The creation of paladins ended up being a turning point, being a pivotal force that ultimately led to the Alliance to victory in the Second War.

However, Stratholme was not safe in the interim. Being a port town, it served as the main source of oil for the Alliance in the northern lands. The Horde maneuvered to sabotage the city’s oil platforms and refineries.

With that operation successful, the Horde then destroyed the entire city of Stratholme. This attack crippled Lordaeron’s navy, as well as cut them off from their elven allies in Quel’Thalas.

In the years following the Second War, Stratholme was rebuilt to even greater glory, but as you may well know, a far darker fate lay ahead. Just before the Third War broke out, infected shipments of grain from Andorhal were delivered to the city.

This grain was infected with a special strain of plague from the Scourge. Any who would consume it would quickly fall ill, die, and rise as an undead. Prince Arthas was investigating the grain and came to Stratholme.

He was shocked to find the entire city’s inhabitants had already consumed the infected grain. They were doomed. The prince made the hard decision to kill the inhabitants of the city, his own people, as a mercy killing.

Uther the Lightbringer and Jaina Proudmoore, who were with him at the time, refused to participate in the slaughter and departed. Arthas was left to do this dark deed with only his most loyal men with the most hardened hearts.

The Nathrezim dreadlord, Mal’ganis, appeared before him and took credit for this horrifying situation. Driven to outage at the dreadlord’s taunts, Arthas lashed out for forcing him to do this, vowing revenge. His path to darkness had only begun.

Mal’ganis made a game of it; he and Prince Arthas competed to kill as many Stratholme citizens as possible. Arthas was determined to keep as many souls away from the demon as possible. The innocents cried out even as they turned into undead against him.

After the purge was complete, Mal’ganis fled to the frozen continent of Northrend, with Arthas chasing after him to find vengeance and, ultimately, his true destiny. Stratholme was left a dead, scorched husk of a city that burns to this day.

After the Culling of Stratholme, Renault stabbed his father Alexandros Mograine, resulting in the corruption of the holy Ashbringer. Stratholme, despite its power and prosperity in the past, has seen among the worst tragedies to ever occur on Azeroth.

Now, Stratholme is home to the Scourge, as well as a contingent of fanatical Scarlet Crusaders dedicated to the eradication of the undead. The two sides are locked in constant, violent combat inside these ravaged ruins of a once-great city.

## Bosses and Encounters

If you look up as we first enter Stratholme, you’ll see banners with the blue “L” on it: the few remaining crests of the Kingdom of Lordaeron, torn and tattered. The Scarlet Crusade’s blood-red “L” seems to say a lot more with that context.

As we enter the city proper, funnily enough, if you look at the signposts, the one pointing south towards the outside says, “To Stranglethorn”. Well… that’s technically true, but… it’s a really unhelpful sign. Was it put there as a joke?

We should take advantage of the fact that the lich **Balzaphon** is here! He is only present during the Scourge invasion, and won’t remain for long.

**Fras Siabi** was one of the most famous merchants in Stratholme; his tobacco was considered legendary. It is said that King Terenas, and even paladins such as Uther the Lightbringer and Tirion Fordring enjoyed his product.

**Postmaster Malown** is dedicated to his work – not hail, sleet, snow, or nosy adventurer will stop the delivery of the mail, not even after his death.

**_Skul_** has no special lore to offer. He was likely just a mage in life who was caught in the Culling.

It’s rare to see the spirit of **_Hearthsinger Forresten_** around. He was a travelling singer and piccolo player, and just happened to be unlucky enough to be within the city when the Culling of Stratholme occurred. An unfortunate victim of circumstance.

**The Unforgiven** was one of Arthas’ soldiers that participated in the culling. Lylia was considered a “blade of righteousness” among her people, but she slowly lost her sanity after seeing so many innocents die by her hand.

In a desperate bid to escape from the madness, she killed herself on her sword. However, she was instead ripped from her body in the form of a wraith. She was denied absolution for her heinous acts, and forever roams the streets of Stratholme in regret.

Timmison was a former champion of the light that was infamous for savagery during combat. Some thought that his sadism stemmed from bullying he endured as a child. When he was reborn in undeath, his once-loathed nickname, **Timmy the Cruel**, returned.

Some speculate that Timmy the Cruel is the same Timmy that Arthas rescued during his days as prince that he later might have seen as a ghoul. However, this theory was debunked by the powers that be. There are many Timmys in this world, apparently.

**Archivist Galford** takes great pride in taking care of the Scarlet Crusade’s most valued documents. He will defend these secrets to the death.

**Malor the Zealous**, true to his name, takes the Scarlet Crusade’s preaching to heart, and will staunchly defend the Scarlet Bastion from the likes of the undead. He keeps a medallion of faith nearby as a sign of his dedication to the cause.

**Cannon Master Willey** is the heavy arms expert of the Scarlet Bastion. In a long drawn-out battle against the Scourge, conservation of ammunition is always important. Willey also seems to have a festive spirit, as he wears a winter hat during the holidays.

**Saidan Dathrohan** was one of the first five paladins of the Knights of the Silver Hand. While he played a minor role in his fellow paladin Tirion Fordring’s tale, the most important event of his “life” was his death.

After the Culling of Stratholme, Saidan led an assault on the Scourge there. During the attack, he was separated by the others and killed by the dreadlord **Balnazzar**. Balnazzar then possessed his body, using magic to prevent its decay.

Balnazzar has had quite the history on Azeroth: he had a hand in creating the original Lich King, staged an unsuccessful ambush to kill Arthas, and was killed by fellow dreadlord Varimathras at Sylvanas’ command to prove his loyalty.

Sylvanas gained the ruins of Lordaeron as a result. True demons are hard to kill, however, as they can only permanently die if killed while within the Twisting Nether. Balnazzar found Saidan while within this state between life and death.

The dreadlord, in the guise of Saidan, whispered in the ears of Renault Mograine that he would gain prestige and honor if he would get out of his father’s shadow… forcefully. Thus, Renault killed his father, Alexandros Mograine, with the Ashbringer.

Balnazzar orchestrated the events that corrupted the Ashbringer and destroyed its wielder, Alexandros. With the Ashbringer’s death, the Scarlet Crusade was born, with High General Abbendis and “Commander Saidan” as their core leaders.

Balnazzar continues to use the Scarlet Commander’s corpse as a puppet for his own ends: increasing his power and destroying threats to his existence.

Hidden in the Scarlet Throne is not just Balnazzar, but the fallen Scarlet Crusader siblings **Sothos** and **Jarien** as well. They were former members of the Veiled Blade mercenary company, and became corrupted by the amulet of black dragonkin Lord Valthalak.

After abandoning the Veiled Blade, they tried to become members of the Scarlet Crusade, but Balnazzar slew them and raised them as undead minions for failing their initiation rites. They could be considered prototypes for Balnazzar’s undead Risen.

They only appear when someone provides a Brazier of Beckoning to summon them out of the shadows.

**Atiesh, the Hand of Sargeras**. This demon is all that stands between us and reforging the Greatstaff of the Guardian. We summon him on consecrated earth, where the greatest of Lordaeronian knights fell, to exorcise the demonic influence from the relic.

He wields a legendary weapon, \[Andonisus, Reaper of Souls\] in each hand, and this is the only place where mortals can wield this lesser-known artifact, too. Andonisus is intrinsically tied to the Twisting Nether, and will return to it in a short time.

**Magistrate Barthilas** was ordained as a paladin in the service of Tirion Fordring just as the Second War ended. As his parents were killed by orcs, he fostered a deep hatred for them.

One day, he found Tirion injured. Barthilas tried to capture Eitrigg the orc, but he was shocked when Tirion defended him. For this, Tirion was arrested for treason, with Barthilas serving as a witness for the trial.

Barthilas planned to torture and execute Eitrigg, but was angry to find that Eitrig and Tirion escaped during an orc raid on the city. During the raid, Barthilas was stabbed in the chest by an orc. He survived, but his rage lived on.

With his injuries he had to retire as a paladin, and instead took up the Magistracy of Stratholme. He never bothered to learn the truth that Eitrigg saved Tirion’s life that day, and now Tirion lives in exile because of Barthilas’ bigotry.

As magistrate, he tried to calm the masses as the plague swept throughout the city, but of course it took his life as it did all the others. The Lich King eventually raised him specifically as a monstrosity to guard his ruined home.

Aurius Rivendare is a paladin of the Silver Hand. He takes refuge here in the Alonsus Chapel, as the consecrated ground staves off the corruption of the Scourge.

He seeks a Medallion of Faith to give him strength enough to leave the chapel without succumbing to the Scourge, allowing him to face his father, Baron Rivendare.

The influence of the Scourge is strong. He will become the new undead Lord of Stratholme in due time.

**Baroness Anastari** was infamous in life for her love of material wealth. She always took what she wanted, no matter the cost. This outlook didn’t change after the Scourge murdered her and she returned as a banshee.

Now, instead of taking gold and jewelry, she has the power to take the minds and bodies of mortals. Her possessiveness knows no bounds. If she cannot have you, she will take your life instead.

The Black Guard are Baron Rivendare’s elite skeletal unit. They stole the blacksmithing plans for the greatsword called Corruption, and the **Black Guard Swordsmith** stands watch over the blueprints. Perhaps they planned to use Corruption for themselves.

**Maleki the Pallid** was among the first to join the Cult of the Damned. This mage hones his dark magic in hopes of one day being remade as a lich to slake his thirst for power. However, his progress remains infuriatingly slow.

Despite his prowess, there are many in the cult who joined after him yet became liches before he could. That may have affected his ego.

**Nerub’enkan** fought in the War of the Spider against the first Lich King. She fell in battle just as many of her brethren did, and was raised as a crypt fiend. She defends this ziggurat just as fiercely as she defended her home in life.

There is nothing particularly notable about the gargoyle, **_Stonespine_**, other than the fact that it is a rare sight to behold.

**Ramstein the Gorger** is an infamous abomination in the Scourge’s ranks, as he is stitched together from more corpses than usual and holds a ceaseless hunger for the living. He was a vicious force when the Scourge originally overran Stratholme.

**  
Baron Rivendare** was a rich landowner before the Third War, and a good friend to the human archmage, Kel’Thuzad. When the first Lich King called out to Kel’Thuzad, he formed the Cult of the Damned, and soon, Baron Rivendare was convinced to join.

As lord of his lands, he ordered the shipment of plagued grain to villages to expedite the spread of infection. When his misdeeds were exposed, he killed his favorite horse, raised it in undeath, renamed it Deathcharger, and became a Death Knight.

He then fled to the burning ruins of Stratholme to serve as a champion of the Scourge. He spends most of his time coordinating attacks against the Scarlet Crusaders stationed on the other side of the city.

His service to the Scourge was recognized and rewarded, as he eventually became a member of the Four Horsemen stationed in Naxxramas. However, he was eventually defeated and his horse’s reins returned to Stratholme to Aurius Rivendare, his son.

## Dungeon History

The island-city of Caer Darrow was built by humans, but even they were preceded by an ancient high elven runestone placed there. During the Second War, the Old Horde invaded, sacked the fortress, and dismantled the runestone.

The runestone’s magic was twisted to build the various Altars of Storms throughout the war, which allowed the Horde to create the first Ogre Magi. The rest of the Horde avoided the Altars, as the intense energies were… unhealthy.

Following the Alliance victory in the Second War, the prominent Barov family rebuilt their primary residence there at Caer Darrow, though their reach extended far further, as they held the deeds to Brill, Southshore, and Tarren Mill.

The Barovs grew restless, greedy, and depressed years before the Third War. Kel’Thuzad approached them with an offer: join the Cult of the Damned so that their lives will be extended and their fortune will be preserved. They readily agreed.

The opulent keep of Caer Darrow was secretly transformed into Scholomance: a school of necromancy for acolytes to the Cult, away from the prying eyes of the public. Family servants were used as experiments.

From here, the plague of undeath was first made and unleashed. The first Abominations were stitched together and created. This place was as much a school as it was a laboratory; many of the magical and scientific advances in undeath began in this place.

Now, the island of Caer Darrow and its surrounding waters lie still. Only the spirits of the victims remain, visible through magical means. The silence hides the devious workings going on below in the necromantic academy of Scholomance.

## Bosses and Encounters

The **Blood Steward of Kirtonos** is a demonic assistant to Kirtonos the Herald, keeping hold of \[Blood of the Innocents\] for him as needed. She is weak-willed enough to be enslaved by a warlock, which can be useful, though that carries its own risks.

**Kirtonos the Herald** was the master of Doctor Theolen Krastinov, and was responsible to Krastinov’s atrocities. Kirtonos has a strong thirst for blood, and delighted in partaking in drinking from his minions’ innocent victims.

However, he rarely stays in Scholomance these days, as he seeks more and more \[Blood of Innocents\] and it’s hard to find such a thing in such a dead land. He flies further out to seek more prey.

There is a sign in Stratholme that indicates that there used to be a “Kirtonos. Bros. Funeral Home”. It appears that Kirtonos may have lived in Stratholme before the Third War.

His gargoyle form is supposed to represent him being a vampyr, but they lacked a proper model for it.

**Lord Blackwood** is here for the Scourge invasion. He was likely a former ruling noble for the now-ruined town of Blackwood in Eastern Plaguelands. However, the House of Blackwood fell in influence, and the Garithos family took over rulership of the town.

During the Second War, the Old Horde marched on to Quel’Thalas, but a small band of orcs branched off and burned Blackwood to the ground, murdering everyone except Othmar Garithos, who eventually became Grand Marshal in the Alliance military.

Othmar Garithos loathed the orcs, but also blamed the elves for the loss of his home and family. It was in large part to his biases that the blood elves left the Alliance. Sometimes, the razing of a small town can change the fate of an entire race.

**Jandice Barov** was an archmage of Dalaran and a specialist in illusions. She developed a modified form of the Mirror Images spell that can create more images and seemingly act independently of each other. She spent years mastering this craft.

For an academy that keeps secrets, Jandice’s tutelage has been invaluable to many students. Her ability to teach illusion magic has allowed the Cult to remain hidden far more effectively.

She also dabbles in other “hobbies”, such as a bit of blood magic and tailoring. She alone knows how to create a \[Felcloth Bag\], and keeps the notes in her journal.

**Rattlegore** is a bone golem of terrifying power. He is used by the inhabitants of Scholomance to harvest “raw materials” from the enemies of the Cult.

**  
Death Knight Darkreaver** was once a great paladin that was seduced by the call of the Lich King. Like other Death Knights before him, he killed and raised his horse as an undead steed to serve him. He bends the wills of the lost souls here in the Ossuary.

Paladins come here to redeem the lost soul of Darkreaver’s steed and claim it as their holy charger. Shamans are called to defeat Darkreaver to calm the disturbance in the spirit world that the Death Knight is causing.

**Marduk Blackpool**, sometimes called Marduk the Black, is a Death Knight that played a vital role in the Battle of Darrowshire during the Third War. He sealed the city’s fate by corrupting the spirit of Joseph Redpath, ensuring victory for the Scourge.

For all his great power, he eventually lost his runeblade during a battle near Corin’s Crossing. A dwarf captain shattered the runeblade on his enchanted shield, and the fractured remnants sank into the earth, creating the Infectis Scar.

Marduk fled to Scholomance, becoming a tutor in the military arts. He still has the hilt of his runeblade as a keepsake of his better days.

**Vectus** is one of the main necromancy teachers of Scholomance. However, his primary focus is the creation of the “plagued dragonflight”, a new form of dragons made specifically for spreading the plague of undeath.

Vectus purchases black dragon eggs from the goblin Tinkee Steamboil in the Burning Steppes. From there, he performs experiments to make his wicked creations. Vectus works to make sure the plagued dragons are as sadistic and flesh-hungry as possible.

**Ras Frostwhisper** was a human hedge mage from Stromgarde – a rogue wizard that never received formal training. He was among the first to join the Cult of the Damned and quickly rose through the ranks.

He eventually went to the slaughterhouse in Stratholme and sliced his neck in half with a dagger on top of the runic circle there, all the while smiling. The Lich King raised his corpse as an immortal lich as a reward for his service.

As a lich, he is one of the most powerful Scourge beings in Scholomance. As such, he is the overseer of the entire facility. He is a favored pupil of Kel’Thuzad.

Unlike most liches, he does not seem to have a phylactery. He can be made to be mortal again, and killed permanently by a different means – using a keepsake from his mortal life.

**Kormok** is an ogre magi necromancer. One head is cheerful but little foolish, while the other head is sly and has a dead look in its eyes. He delighted in spending time at Purgation Isle and summoning and torturing the souls there.

He then decided to enroll at Scholomance to further his studies, and quickly became one of Ras Frostwhisper’s servants. He holds one of the pieces of Lord Valthalak’s Amulet. We need a Brazier of Beckoning to bring him out of hiding.

**Doctor Theolen Krastinov** is a butcher of unspeakable brutality. He tortures his victims for months on end, paying no heed to their pleas for mercy. He uses magical means to keep his targets alive and aware of what he’s doing to them during vivisection.

Krastinov played a vital role in the creation of the plague of undeath, as it was through his keen knowledge of the inner workings of the living that the Cult of the Damned was able to make such fast progress.

While never stated explicitly, chances are he played a big role in the creation of the first abominations.

**Lorekeeper Polkelt** is a pitiful being. Once a keeper of knowledge, but all of it has been lost now that he has been reduced to a mindless minion of the Scourge. Once killed, his body can still sometimes twitch.

**Instructor Malicia** is a high elf; interesting to see considering how much the elves despise the Lich King for his massacre at Quel’Thalas. It seems she is a renegade among her kind, seduced by the Lich King’s power.

**Lady Illucia Barov** is the wife of Lord Alexei Barov, and a practitioner of shadow magic.

**Lord Alexei Barov** is the lord of Caer Darrow, Brill, Tarren Mill, and Southshore. He was ultimately the one who agreed to join the Cult of the Damned and transform Caer Darrow into Scholomance. He stands now as a Death Knight in service to the Scourge.

In later years he comes to regret his decision, and calls for help in destroying the Scourge presence in Caer Darrow. His spirit becomes purified in the Light for his acts of redemption.

**The Ravenian** is a wight and one of Kel’Thuzad’s mightiest agents. It is used as a threat against the students of the school – show any sign of weakness, and the Ravenian will devour them. Only the brightest and most powerful students graduate.

**  
Darkmaster Gandling** was formerly a wizard of Dalaran, but he eventually abandoned his former masters to become a student of the lich, Ras Frostwhisper.

Impressed by his knowledge and capacity for leadership, Kel’Thuzad personally appointed Gandling as the headmaster of the school of necromancy here in Scholomance, with Ras Frostwhisper as Overseer.

Despite his dark tendencies, Gandling has a festive side. He wears a special hat during the holiday season.

![Blackrock Spire](https://i.imgur.com/SlxWukL.jpg)

## Dungeon History

Around 250 years ago, the three rival dwarf clans fought each other in the War of Three Hammers. It was a brutal war, but the key moment that ended it was when the cornered leader of the Dark Irons, Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan, acted in desperation.

Intending to merely blast his enemies, he instead mistakenly summoned Ragnaros, the Elemental Lord of Fire. The surge of heat scorched the earth black, destroying everything in a wide berth and creating the Searing Gorge and the Burning Steppes.

In the place where Ragnaros emerged stood the volcano named Blackrock Mountain, which became a vital headquarters for the Old Horde during the First and Second Wars. Blackrock Spire was the home of the Shadow Council during the First War.

Ragnaros and his minions, as well as the Dark Irons, did not appreciate this intrusion. However, Cho’gall the Ogre Mage convinced them to allow their stay as long as the two sides did not interfere with each other.

When the Old Horde successfully destroyed Stormwind City during the First War, the Warchief Orgrim Doomhammer rode on to Blackrock Mountain to kill the Shadow Council as traitors to the Old Horde, though Gul’dan weaseled his way into being spared.

The Blackrock Clan then settled into the fortress. The name was a coincidence; the orcish clan was named for Blackrock ore back in Draenor. Blackrock Spire continued to serve as the headquarters for the leadership of the Horde during the Second War.

As the Second War came to a close, the Horde had been pushed back into the mountain, with the Alliance closing in. During the Siege of Blackrock Spire, the Alliance was preparing their siege engines when the Horde suddenly opened the gates and charged.

Orgrim Doomhammer made a dash straight for the Alliance Commander, Anduin Lothar, and the two dueled in the midst of one of the bloodiest battles of the Second War. Orgrim eventually brought down the Doomhammer on Lothar’s skull, killing him instantly.

Doomhammer proclaimed his victory, and the orcs cheered on. However, the paladin Turalyon picked up Lothar’s shattered greatsword and unleashed a wave of Light, inspiring the Alliance to counterattack. He disarmed Doomhammer and forced a surrender.

Such ended the Second War. The orcs were captured and put into internment camps. However, a few orcs escaped, freed their brethren, returned to Blackrock Spire and resumed their ways as the Dark Horde, as they call it, the “True Horde”.

They spit on Thrall’s New Horde, which does not follow the ways of the Old Horde from the First and Second Wars. They apparently do not mind the Black Dragon Nefarian, who made his roost in Blackrock Spire and uses the Dark Horde as his own army.

In truth, the Dark Horde embraces Nefarian’s patronage, as they need his power to fight off the other inhabitants of Blackrock Mountain, Ragnaros and his minions, the Dark Iron Dwarves. The two sides vie for control of the mountain.

## Bosses and Encounters

## Lower Blackrock Spire

Vaelan is the red dragon, Vaelastrasz, in disguise. He infiltrated the area to learn what was going on in Blackrock Spire and put a stop to the black dragon Nefarian’s evil plans.

However, the path to Upper Blackrock Spire and Blackwing Lair are locked away. He has plans to create a \[Seal of Ascension\] to allow adventurers to gain access to those areas.

A shortcut was eventually made to Blackwing Lair so the Seal of Ascension wasn’t required, but hey, at least he tried. At least Vaelan’s method doesn’t permanently brand our skin with the mark of the black dragonflight.

**_Bannok Grimaxe_** is a helpful fellow, as he can drop the blacksmithing plans for the popular Arcanite Reaper.

Scarshield Warlocks can open portals, and rarely a **_Burning Felguard_** can emerge from them. They offer unique loot, so we’re lucky to see one!

**_Ghok Bashguud_** is “guud” at bashing and is a champion of some sort, but that’s all we have in terms of lore.

The **_Spirestone Butcher_** is a rare sight, but it’s unknown if his title is food-related or war-crime-related. Perhaps it’s both.

The **_Spirestone Battle Lord_** is merely a guardian of Highlord Omokk. While he protects the Highlord from intruders, he does not interfere with one-on-one duels for leadership of the ogres – not that he has to, since the challengers die anyway.

The **_Spirestone Lord Magus_** is a guardian of Highlord Omokk. As an ogre mage living in Blackrock Spire, he may be a veteran from the Second War, which means he learned his arts directly from an Altar of Storms.

**Highlord Omokk** rules over the spire ogres. Underlings challenge him to single combat to try and seize the title, but all of them mysteriously die before the battle begins. This led to rumors that dark magic is protecting Omokk, so few challenge him now.

In truth, Urok Doomhowl discreetly murders the challengers to keep the minions in line. That way, nothing would disrupt the chain of command.

**Shadow Hunter Vosh’gajin** is a formidable fighter, capable of curses and hexes in addition to her sword skills. She is renowned for her beauty and psychotic tendencies among trolls. Kilram, a troll blacksmith living in Everlook, was her former lover.

**War Master Voone** is a veteran of the Second War capable of leading small strike teams into the heart of Quel’Thalas to slay his ancient elven enemies and withdrawing without taking any losses.

Voone does not believe in the Dark Horde’s ideology, but joined anyway with the intent of becoming the chief strategist. He sees the Dark Horde as the underdog, and he loves the satisfaction of overcoming insurmountable odds.

**Mor Grayhoof** was the first of the mercenary company, The Veiled Blade, to die. As he fled Upper Blackrock Spire, he fell down here. He survived the fall, but heavily injured as he was, he was tortured by the Tazz’Alaor trolls and War Master Voone.

Broken and beaten, he was finished off by spectral assassins. His crazed spirit now haunts this area. He holds a piece of Lord Valthalak’s Amulet, and requires a Brazier of Beckoning to pull him into the physical world.

**Mother Smolderweb** is centuries old. The Dark Irons accidentally dug into her lair hundreds of years ago, releasing her into the spire. She’s content to stay where she is, increasing the size of her brood. The Dark Horde fear to tread across her domain.

**_Crystal Fang_**, like its name implies, is known for its crystalline appearance. However, it offers no particular lore.

**Urok Doomhowl** is the true leader of the spire ogres. He used magic to charm Omokk into being a “Highlord” to control his minions in his stead as part of a clever charade to keep himself safe yet maintain power.

**Quartermaster Zigris** is a famed hunter among the orcs. After the orcs destroyed Stormwind City, he was skilled in tracking down Stormwind refugees and slaughtering them.

He hates to be cloistered in the claustrophobic halls of Blackrock Spire, and wishes he could roam beneath the open air and hunt again.

**Halycon** comes from a long line of worgs bred for loyalty and ferocity. She has produced numerous savage offspring to become the pride of the Dark Horde. Rumors say she is too good to be true – that she is a demon gifted to Rend Blackhand by a pit lord.

Very few have seen **Gizrul the Slavener**. He prefers to be reclusive and hide in his shadowy den, only to emerge when his mate Halycon calls to him. These monstrously huge worgs have produced the largest and most fearsome worgs in orcish history.

**Overlord Wyrmthalak** is a black dragonspawn that oversees the lower spire forces. He does not care for the Dark Horde, so he callously sacrifices any number of them in their territorial fight against the Dark Iron Dwarves.

## Upper Blackrock Spire

**Pyroguard Emberseer** is a loyal minion of Ragnaros the Firelord and incinerated dozens of Blackrock orcs in battle. However, Emberseer was ultimately defeated and imprisoned here, where his heat is siphoned for use in incubating Nefarian’s eggs.

**Solakar Flamewreath** is in charge of taking care of the whelps in the Rookery. It is an important task, and one that carries a high price for failure should any whelp die under his supervision, or even if any whelp fails to live up to expectations.

It’s such a high risk job. Solakar always feels like he’s walking on eggshells.

**Goraluk Anvilcrack** sold his soul to a rhyming satyr named Lorax in Frostwhisper Gorge in Winterspring. He broke the deal, so his soul we must steal, and armorsmiths shall gain great weal. He also wears a festive hat during the holidays. …most ideal!

Hey, it’s Jed! Say hi to Jed. People like Jed. Be like Jed! **_Jed Runewatcher_**, everybody! \*Massive cheers\*

**Gyth** is a member of Nefarian’s experimental chromatic dragonflight: using mixed genetics of all the dragonflights together in order to create a powerful dragon with all of the strengths and none of the weaknesses.

This unnatural state of being is created through magic and alchemy, and is very unstable. Most chromatic dragons die before they even hatch; those that survive are usually deformed, short-lived, or insane.

Gyth was one of the few successes. He was magically aged to adulthood, then given to Dal’Rend Blackhand as a mount.

**Dal’rend Blackhand** is the son of Blackhand the Destroyer, the first Warchief of the Horde. He claims that he is the Warchief of the Horde by right of lineage, and looks down on Thrall and his “New Horde” that turns away from the old ways.

He had a short childhood, as during the days of the Old Horde, orc children were artificially aged into adults by warlocks to keep up the stock of war-aged troops. He and his brother Maim willingly drank the blood of the pit lord Mannoroth.

They happily served as leaders of the Black Tooth Grin clan during the First War, but unhappily served as lieutenants during the Second War under the Warchief Orgrim Doomhammer after he killed their father Blackhand the Destroyer.

After the orcish defeat in the Siege of Blackrock Spire, Rend and Maim retreated and hid within the mountain to rebuild the Dark Horde. In time, Nefarian came and they accepted his patronage.

**The Beast** was captured from Molten Core. Nefarian and his dragonkin delight in torturing Ragnaros’ minions. This one was retrained to be a guard for the upper levels of Blackrock Spire, despite suffering mistreatment at every opportunity.

Finkle Einhorn is a gnomish explorer that was testing his lava suit in the Molten Span inside of Blackrock Mountain when he was swallowed by The Beast. Assuming he’s not a liar, he apparently spent months inside thanks to a food dispenser inside the suit.

He also has a son, who he’s apparently not very fond of. When his son runs off into Blackrock Spire with one of his favored knives, he wants the knife back and doesn’t bother to ask about his son’s fate.

**Lord Valthalak** is a draconid warlock of immense power, and was the ruler of Upper Blackrock Spire before General Drakkisath. The mercenary group called the Veiled Blade slew him, but that was only the beginning of their troubles.

Valthalak used soul manipulation magic to house a portion of his spirit into his amulet, which caused the Veiled Blade to become obsessed with its power. They fought over who should have it, and in the argument, split it into pieces.

Valthalak’s ghost rose in its place, as well as an army of spectral assassins. The Veiled Blade ran from the Spire and disbanded, never to return. The spectral assassins would follow them to the ends of Azeroth and ensure their lives were forfeit.

His influence lingers. It is only through gathering the pieces of the shattered amulet that he can be remade. While he hates the Veiled Blade for stealing his soul, he respects us for returning it so that he may rest eternally.

We can summon Lord Valthalak’s spirit through a Brazier of Beckoning specially made for him and placing it in The Beast’s room, which used to be Valthalak’s headquarters. General Drakkisath left this room in disrepair. Did he not respect his predecessor?

**General Drakkisath** is a cunning and ruthless strategist. He commands Nefarian’s armies in his war against Ragnaros the Firelord. He shows no mercy and expects none in return. He commands a lot of respect from his minions, as he keeps his promises.

He is fiercely loyal to Nefarian, and will stop at nothing to see his master’s will done. He personally holds a brand that permanently marks the skin of minions loyal and trusted enough to teleport directly into Blackwing Lair.

For the hardcore purists out there, yes, much of the boss lore here was taken from the dungeon journal, which is post-vanilla. However, it is official Blizzard lore, and I’ve scrubbed any post-vanilla references from their entries (though a few special cases or fan-favorite bosses have post-vanilla info marked with purple text). If I didn’t do this, 90% of all dungeon bosses would have no lore whatsoever. Take it or leave it; I feel as though something is better than nothing. It’s mostly harmless fluff lore anyhow.
