# WoW Classic Horde Leveling Guide

Hello and welcome to our 1-60 horde leveling guide for WoW Classic! There are multiple ways to level up in Azeroth, but this guide will make things simple for you. The quests and grinding sessions included are sequenced to get you to level 60 as fast as possible!

This guide does use a combination of questing, grinding, and a few dungeons (skippable). It will still take you multiple days of in-game played time to finish, but you’ll get there in due time if you carefully follow each step below. Without further ado, let’s get to leveling!

Guidelines
Race Choices – This guide is designed to be usable with every horde race. If you’re an orc or troll, this won’t require any extra work from you. Undead and tauren characters can follow this guide if you jump in at level 12. There are a few places where this affects the guide, but we’ll explain them when it happens.
Hearthstones & Inns – Only change your hearthstone home location when indicated in the guide. You’re going to use it several times to return to specific locations. Additionally, try not to use your hearthstone unless mentioned during the guide so you have it available when needed. Whenever you’re finished with a leveling session, always try and return to an inn so you can accumulate rested experience.
Chain Quests – WoW Classic is packed full of chain quests. Some of these are quite fun and lead to great rewards, while others are a waste of time. This guide takes chain quests into consideration and only lists chain quests that you should accept. Meaning, if a quest is not listed in the guide and you see it from a quest giver, don’t pick it up! This can cause your quest log to fill up if you take too many quests that aren’t covered.
Grinding – Grinding is an inevitable part of your leveling journey, but fortunately there isn’t too much of it. Grinding sessions will be distributed evenly throughout the guide so you won’t ever need to spend countless hours doing it. To cut down on the time that you do spend grinding, kill every monster you see when running between quest objectives.
Dungeons – There are multiple instances where it is recommended to run a dungeon. Dungeons are excellent sources of loot, but they also usually have quests associated with them to give you boatloads of experience. You do need to find a group, but the hassle is definitely worth it. Dungeons are all optional, but you will need to spend more time grinding to make up for it instead.
Confused? – We tried our best to make this guide as coherent as possible, but everyone makes mistakes! If there is anything that doesn’t make sense or you can’t find something, click the link in the guide to find detailed information and locations of NPCs.

There isn’t a specific amount, but eventually one will shout aloud as they die. When this happens, Verog the Dervish will appear. Slay him and don’t forget to loot his corpse.
The Stagnant Oasis is one of the best places to grind for your level, so you’ll want to kill centaurs and turtles in the area until you reach level 16. Focus on the Kolkar Bloodcharger, but switch to Oasis Snapjaw when there aren’t any left alive. This will take you somewhere between 50 and 100 kills depending on your RNG for quest item drops and how much grinding you’ve done.

When you see a small camp with three raptors around it, you’ve reached the right spot. Kill all three raptors and look around where they were standing to find the Stolen Silver.

Once finished, keep running north until you hit the Stagnant Oasis. Now head west to reach Lushwater Oasis. Kill Oasis Snapjaws until you have enough shells to complete Altered Beings. 
You also need to kill Hezrul Bloodmark while you’re still here. He patrols around the oasis and has two bodyguards with him, so try to take them both out and run away so you can fight him one-on-one. When you have a fair fight, kill Hezrul and loot his head.

Keep following the road west through Astranaar until it begins to curve north. Start running along the road north until you get to Maestra’s Post.
