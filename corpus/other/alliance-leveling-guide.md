This part can be counted as a Class Quest for Paladins and should not be done if you are another class (except Warrior if you aren’t getting Whirlwind Axe). At this point your current weapon will most likely be something like ArcheusArcheus, or maybe even worse. It’s starting to get outdated at this point, and unless you are planning on running all wings of SM soon to get BonebiterBonebiter I would suggest you to do this part, it should take around 30 mins solo or faster if you can get some help and you will get a really good weapon.

Now we need to kill some cultist elites to continue, it’s possible to solo the Twilight Dark Shamans you can find to the west outside the cave, just interrupt their heals and you should be fine, the Fire Guards are much harder so avoid them. Getting a group for this will make it much easier. If you can’t solo them or get a group you can skip these quests for now and come back and do them later, around level 50 and you should have no problems doing it.
Kill a few cultists until you loot Symbol of Ragnaros. If you get a group you can run up the hill next to the cave and you will find a night elf sitting in a cage next to a pool of lava, the best way to do this is to have one party member aggro all the cultists and run away while the other members get the quest, then repeat for all members in the party. Accept Prayer to ElunePrayer to Elune, talk with the night elf and turn it in. Accept the follow up.

Ding 60!
60+ The End
We have now reached the end of the guide. I hope you found it helpful and you reached 60 in a good time. I will continue to work on the guide after Classic launch and fix/change things to make it better over time.

You still have a few elite quests scattered around Azeroth to do, and of course lots of dungeon quests. If you are not yet 60 I recommend any of the following:

Grind! Probably the fastest way to 60, some spots I recommend are:
-Furbolgs in Winterspring
Timbermaw rep, Firewater,Winterfall E’ko
-Owlbeasts in Winterspring
Lots of vendor greys
-Elementals in Silithus
Hydraxian rep, Elemental earth, Essence of Earth
-Satyrs in Felwood
Runecloth, Felcloth, Demonic runes
-Blackrock Orcs in BS
Runecloth, greys, others.
Complete any remaining quests scattered around Azeroth There are still some elite quests to do in the higher level zones, try to look for groups and do them.
Run some end game dungeons and do the quests BRD and Strat have a lot of dungeon quests, so those would be preferred to do to maximize your XP gains. You could also do some quick 2-3 boss runs in LBRS to start farming pre-raid bis gear.
