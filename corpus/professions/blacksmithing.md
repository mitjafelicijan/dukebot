# Classic WoW Blacksmithing Leveling Guide 1-300

![](/images/icons/professions/blacksmithing.png)This Classic WoW Blacksmithing Leveling Guide will show you the fastest and easiest way to level your Blacksmithing skill up from 1 to 300.

Blacksmithing uses a lot of ores, so I recommend leveling this profession together with Mining because you will need a lot of gold if you want to buy everything from the Auction House. Check out my [Classic Mining leveling guide 1-300](/classic/mining-leveling-guide-classic-wow) if you want to level Mining.

I recommend trying [Zygor's 1-60 Leveling Guide](/recommends/zygor-classic-leveling) if you are still leveling your character or just starting a new alt. It will help you to reach level 60 a lot faster.
