# Classic WoW Enchanting Leveling Guide 1-300

![](/images/icons/professions/enchanting.png)This Classic WoW Enchanting Leveling Guide will show you the fastest and easiest way to level your Enchanting skill up from 1 to 300.

If you still haven't decided about your second profession, I think Enchanting goes well with Tailoring because you don't need a gathering profession to support either of them, and you can also use Enchanting to disenchant the items you made with Tailoring. Check out my [Classic Tailoring leveling guide](/classic/tailoring-leveling-guide-classic-wow) if you want to level Tailoring.

I recommend trying [Zygor's 1-60 Leveling Guide](/recommends/zygor-classic-leveling) if you are still leveling your character or just starting a new alt. It will help you to reach level 60 a lot faster.

### Cataclysm Classic

There are a lot of changes to trainers and recipes in Cataclysm, so you should use my [Cataclysm Enchanting leveling guide](/cataclysm/enchanting-leveling-guide-cataclysm-classic) instead.

## Classic Enchanting Trainer Location

To become an Apprentice Enchanter you need to reach level 5 and find an Enchanting trainer.

Just click on any of these links below to see the trainer's exact location. You can also walk up to a guard in any city and ask where the Enchanting trainer is, then it will be marked with a red flag on your map

**Horde trainers:**

*   [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Jhag](/npc/jhag-enchanting-trainer-classic) in Orgrimmar.
*   [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Malcomb Wynn](/npc/malcomb-wynn-enchanting-trainer-classic) in Undercity.

## Leveling Classic Enchanting

    1x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_staff_goldfeathered_01.jpg)Runed Copper Rod](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6218) - 1 Copper Rod, 1 Strange Dust, 1 Lesser Magic Essence
    
    [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_flute_01.jpg)Copper Rod](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6217) is sold by Trade Goods, Trade Supplies, and Enchanting Supplies vendors. They are usually near your trainer, so don't buy it from the Auction House.
    

*   **2-50**  
    Disenchant green quality items or make the following:
    
    48x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_holy_greaterheal.jpg)Enchant Bracer: Minor Health](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=7418) - 48 Strange Dust
    

## Enchanting Journeyman

You can only train Enchanting past 75 if you learn Journeyman Enchanting. Not every Enchanting trainer will teach you this skill, you have to find an Expert Enchanter. (Requires level 10)

You can learn Journeyman Enchanting from these NPCs below:

**Horde trainers:**

*   [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Godan](/npc/godan-classic) in Orgrimmar.
*   [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Lavinia Crowe](/npc/lavinia-crowe-classic) in Undercity.

*   [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Taladan](/npc/taladan-classic) in Darnassus.

### 50 - 110

*   **50-90**  
    40x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_holy_greaterheal.jpg)Enchant Bracer: Minor Health](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=7418) - 40 Strange Dust
    
    If Strange Dust is cheap and Greater Magic Essence is expensive on your realm, you can make this Enchant up to 120.
    

*   **90-100**  
    10x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_holy_greaterheal.jpg)Enchant Bracer: Minor Stamina](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=7457) - 30 Strange Dust

*   **100-101**  
    1x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_staff_01.jpg)Runed Silver Rod](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6339) - 1 Silver Rod, 6 Strange Dust, 3 Greater Magic Essence, 1 Shadowgem

*   **101-110**  
    9x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_staff_07.jpg)Greater Magic Wand](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11288) - 9 Simple Wood, 9 Greater Magic Essence

### 110 - 135

Buy these two recipes [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_note_01.jpg)Formula: Enchant Bracer - Lesser Strength](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11101), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_note_01.jpg)Formula: Enchant Cloak - Minor Agility](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11039) from [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Kulwia](/npc/classic/kulwia) (Horde) in Stonetalon Mountains, or from [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Dalria](/npc/classic/dalria) (Alliance) in Ashenvale.

These are limited supply recipes. If someone bought them before you, then you have to wait for it to respawn. I'm not sure about the exact respawn timer, but it's between 30-50 min.

25x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_holy_greaterheal.jpg)Enchant Cloak: Minor Agility](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13419) - 25 Lesser Astral Essence

#### Alternative recipe

Make the recipe below if Astral essence is expensive on your realm and you can find cheap Small Glimmering Shards.

28x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_holy_greaterheal.jpg)Enchant 2H Weapon - Minor Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=7745) - 112 Strange Dust, 28 Small Glimmering Shard

## Enchanting Expert

To become an Expert Enchanter you need to reach level 20 and level up Enchanting to 125, then find an Expert Enchanting trainer.

There is only one Expert Enchanting trainer for each faction. [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Kitta Firewind](/npc/classic/kitta-firewind) in Elwynn Forest is the Alliance trainer. She is at the top level of the Tower of Azora.

[![](/images/icons/horde.png)Hgarth](/npc/classic/hgarth) in Stonetalon Mountains at Sun Rock Retreat is the Horde trainer. He is up on the hill, there's a steep path that leads up to him. It's not easily noticeable.

### 135 - 156

*   **135-155**  
    20x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_holy_greaterheal.jpg)Enchant Bracer - Lesser Stamina](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13501) - 40 Soul Dust

*   **155-156**  
    1x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_staff_10.jpg)Runed Golden Rod](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11130) - 1 Golden Rod, 1 Iridescent Pearl, 2 Greater Astral Essence, 2 Soul Dust

### 156 - 185

40x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_holy_greaterheal.jpg)Enchant Bracer - Lesser Strength](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13536) - 80 Soul Dust

Check the "110-135" step for recipe location.

#### Alternative recipe

If 1x Lesser Mystic Essence is a lot cheaper than 2x Soul Dust then you can switch to this recipe at 165:

20x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_holy_greaterheal.jpg)Enchant Bracer: Spirit](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13642) - 20 Lesser Mystic Essence

### 185 - 225

*   **185-200**  
    15x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_holy_greaterheal.jpg)Enchant Bracer: Strength](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13661) - 15 Vision Dust

*   **200-201**  
    1x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_staff_11.jpg)Runed Truesilver Rod](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11145) - 1 Truesilver Rod, 1 Black Pearl, 2 Greater Mystic Essence, 2 Vision Dust

*   **201-220**  
    35x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_holy_greaterheal.jpg)Enchant Bracer: Strength](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13661) - 35 Vision Dust
    
    The enchant will be yellow, so you should buy enough dust to make it around 30-35 times.
    

*   **220-225**  
    5x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_holy_greaterheal.jpg)Enchant Cloak: Greater Defense](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13746) - 15 Vision Dust

## Enchanting Artisan

To become an Artisan Enchanter you need to reach level 35 and level up Enchanting to 200, then find an Artisan Enchanting trainer.

### How to find the Artisan Enchanting trainer

You can find [Annora](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11073) the Artisan Enchanting trainer in Uldaman. She is the only trainer that can teach you Artisan Enchanting.

There are a couple of recipes that only Annora can teach you, **so you should bring enough gold to learn every recipe and enough enchanting materials to reach Enchanting 250**. Else you would have to go back to Uldaman again for the higher-level recipes.

In total, you will need 11.79 Gold to learn everything from Annora, and around 200 [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_enchant_dustvision.jpg)Vision Dust](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11137) should get you to Enchanting 250.

### How to enter Uldaman

The Uldaman instance is located in Badlands. It has two entrances, you should enter from the back entrance.

You can't solo Uldaman at level 35, so you either have to go there with a party or ask a level 60 to help you out.

![](/images/classic/uldaman-backdoor-t.jpg)

### Annora's location inside Uldaman

Annora will only spawn once you **kill every mob in the area she is in!**

![](/images/classic/artisan-enchanter-trainer-t.jpg)

### 225 - 250

*   **225-230**  
    5x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_holy_greaterheal.jpg)Enchant Gloves: Agility](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13815) - 5 Lesser Nether Essence, 5 Vision Dust
    
    Make [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_holy_greaterheal.jpg)Enchant Cloak: Greater Defense](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13746), if you don't have Lesser Nether Essence.
    

*   **230-235**  
    5x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_holy_greaterheal.jpg)Enchant Boots - Stamina](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13836) - 25 Vision Dust

*   **235-250**  
    25x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_holy_greaterheal.jpg)Enchant Chest: Superior Health](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13858) - 150 Vision Dust

**Don't forget to learn everything from Annora before you leave Uldaman!**

Try to hunt for [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_note_01.jpg)Formula: Enchant Bracer - Greater Stamina](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11225) at the Auction House. It's a random world drop, but this recipe is the best to level Enchanting from 245 to 265 or even 285.

### 250 - 265

20x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_potion_99.jpg)Lesser Mana Oil](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25127) - 60 Dream Dust, 40 Purple Lotus, 20 Crystal Vial

You can make this one up to 270 if you can get cheap purple lotus.

[Kania](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=15419) sells the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_note_01.jpg)Formula: Lesser Mana Oil](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20754) in Silithus. She is upstairs in the Inn.

#### Season of Discovery Alternative recipe

The NPC is not yet available in SoD Phase 3. Use this recipe as an alternative:

17x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_holy_greaterheal.jpg)Enchant Bracer - Greater Strength](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=13939) - 34x Dream Dust, 17x Greater Nether Essence

### 265 - 294

30x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_holy_greaterheal.jpg)Enchant Shield: Greater Stamina](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20017) - 300 Dream Dust

The recipe is sold by [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Daniel Bartlett](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=4561) at Undercity, and by [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Mythrin'dir](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=4229) at Darnassus.

**IMPORTANT!** The recipe binds when picked up! Don't make the mistake of trying to buy it with an alt and mail it. It's also limited in supply, this means you have to wait if someone bought it before you.

### 294 - 295

1x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_wand_09.jpg)Runed Arcanite Rod](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16207) - 1 Arcanite Rod, 1 Golden Pearl, 10 Illusion Dust, 4 Greater Eternal Essence, 4 Small Brilliant Shard, 2 Large Brilliant Shard

[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_note_01.jpg)Formula: Runed Arcanite Rod](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16243) is sold by [Lorelae Wintersong](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=12022) in Moonglade at Nighthaven. The next recipe is also sold by her, so don't leave before you buy that one too.

### 295 - 300

5x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_holy_greaterheal.jpg)Enchant Cloak: Superior Defense](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20015) - 40 Illusion Dust

[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_note_01.jpg)Formula: Enchant Cloak - Superior Defense](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16224) is sold by [Lorelae Wintersong](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=12022) in Moonglade at Nighthaven.

You can continue to make [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_holy_greaterheal.jpg)Enchant Shield: Greater Stamina](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20017) if you have a lot of dream dust, or Illusion Dust is really expensive.

  
Congratulations on reaching 300! Please [send feedback](/contact) about the guide if you think there are parts I could improve, or you found typos, errors, wrong material numbers!
