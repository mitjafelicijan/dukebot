# Weaponsmith Specialization in WoW Classic

Weaponsmith is a Blacksmithing specialization that allows access to powerful weapon recipes. This guide will show you how to become a Weaponsmith in Classic WoW.

You must level your character to **level 40** and have at least **200 Blacksmithing skill** before you can choose a Blacksmithing specialization. Check out my [Classic Blacksmithing leveling guide](/classic/blacksmithing-leveling-guide-classic-wow) if your skill is not high enough.

## Weaponsmith Quest

To become a weaponsmith, you must first talk to [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Krathok Moltenfist](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11176) in Orgrimmar or [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Myolor Sunderfury](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=11145) in Ironforge and click on **"I wish to become a weaponsmith"**. This is an important step, you won't see the Weaponsmith quest if you don't talk to these NPCs.

Then go to the nearby weaponsmith trainer [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Borgosh Corebender](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11178) (Horde) or [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Ironus Coldsteel](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11146) (Alliance) and pick up the quest [![](/images/icons/quest_start.gif)The Way of the Weaponsmith](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=5302).

You will need these weapons to complete the quest:

*   4x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_sword_25.jpg)Moonsteel Broadsword](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=3496)

### Do you need to craft the recipes?

No, you don't have to craft these yourself to get credit for completing the quest. You just have to have these in your inventory. You can ask someone to craft them for you, or you can buy all of them from the Auction House.
