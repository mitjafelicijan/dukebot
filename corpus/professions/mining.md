# Classic WoW Mining Leveling Guide 1-300

![](/images/icons/professions/mining.png)This Classic WoW Mining leveling guide will show you the fastest way how to level your Mining profession up from 1 to 300.

Mining serves two professions: Blacksmithing and Engineering, so it's really good combined with these two. Check out my [Classic Blacksmithing leveling guide](/classic/blacksmithing-leveling-guide-classic-wow) or my [Classic Engineering leveling Guide](/classic/engineering-leveling-guide-classic-wow) if you want to level any of two professions.

I recommend trying [Zygor's 1-60 Leveling Guide](/recommends/zygor-classic-leveling) if you are still leveling your character or just starting a new alt. It will help you to reach level 60 a lot faster.

## Classic Mining Leveling

Every starter zone is filled with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_ore_copper_01.jpg)Copper Ore](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2770), it doesn't really matter which one you choose.

**Night Elf** players have to wait until they get to Darkshore before they can start leveling mining because Teldrassil doesn't have any Copper Ore.

Don't forget to buy a [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_pick_02.jpg)Mining Pick](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2901) from the Mining Supply vendor near your trainer! You don't have to equip it, but you have to have one in your inventory.

## 1 - 65

*   [Durotar](#1-50-tab-1)
*   [Mulgore](#1-50-tab-2)
*   [Tirisfal Glades](#1-50-tab-3)
*   [Elwynn Forest](#1-50-tab-4)
*   [Darkshore](#1-50-tab-5)
*   [Dun Morogh](#1-50-tab-6)

High level players should always enter the Venture Co. Mine because you will get around 8 Copper Veins from clearing both the mine and the small area after the mine at the side the mountain. (you can only access this area from the mine)

It can be a nightmare to find the exit the first time you are there so I included a small map. **You won't see this map in-game**, because it's from the Cataclysm expansion, but the layout is the same. Make sure to go to every corner of the cave!

Low level players should skip both caves.

Low level players should skip both caves.

![](/images/classic/mining-leveling-darkshore.jpg)

The respawn rate is fast enough that you don't have to loop around the whole zone, so you can use these two routes. If you have competition, you should move between the two routes while mining copper between them.

![](/images/classic/mining-leveling-dun-morogh.jpg)

## 65 - 125

Visit your trainer and learn Journeyman Mining. (You need to level up Mining to at least 50)

Ores in these zones: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_ore_tin_01.jpg)Tin Ore](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2771), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_ore_copper_01.jpg)Copper Ore](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2770), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_stone_16.jpg)Silver Ore](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2775)

At 75 you can learn how to smelt Silver Ore, this will help you get your skill to 125. Silver Ore and bars sell for rougly the same, buy the ore and sell the bars at the auction house.

*   [Hillsbrad Foothills](#65-125-tab-1)
*   [Redridge Mountains](#65-125-tab-2)
*   [Ashenvale](#65-125-tab-3)
*   [The Barrens](#65-125-tab-4)

Low level players should skip the two caves marked with red circles.

![](/images/classic/mining-leveling-hillsbrad.jpg)

Low level players should skip both caves and stick to the east side of Redridge.

![](/images/classic/mining-leveling-redridge.jpg)

The respawn rate should be fast enough that you don't have to enter the cave marked on the map, but there is always two Tin Veins inside, so I think it's worth to go inside with high level characters.

![](/images/classic/mining-leveling-ashenvale.jpg)

There is more Tin/Copper at the southern route, but you can use the northern route as an alternative if there are too many people farming in the zone. The difference between the two is not that big.

![](/images/classic/mining-leveling-barrens.jpg)

## 125 - 175

Visit your trainer and learn Expert Mining. (You need to level up Mining to at least 125)

Ores in these zones: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_ore_iron_01.jpg)Iron Ore](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2772), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_ore_tin_01.jpg)Tin Ore](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2771), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_ore_copper_01.jpg)Gold Ore](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2776)

At 155 you can learn how to smelt Gold Ore. Buy around 30 Gold Ore then smelt them, this should get you to around 175. Same as with Silver Ores, buy them, smelt them and sell the bars at the Auction House.

*   [Arathi Highlands](#125-175-tab-1)
*   [Desolace](#125-175-tab-2)
*   [Thousand Needles](#125-175-tab-3)

There are 4 caves marked with red circles on the map, make sure to go all the way to the end of each cave because you won't see all the mining veins from the entrance.

Low level players should skip all 4 caves, and low level Alliance players should take a detour and go south of Hammerfall!

![](/images/classic/mining-leveling-thousand-needles.jpg)

## 175 - 245

**Don't forget to visit your Mining trainer and learn Artisan Mining when you reach 225!** (You need to level up Mining to at least 200)

Ores in these zones: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_ore_mithril_02.jpg)Mithril Ore](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3858), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_ore_truesilver_01.jpg)Truesilver Ore](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7911)

*   [The Hinterlands](#175-245-tab-1)
*   [Tanaris](#175-245-tab-2)

The red route should be skipped by lower level players because the area is filled with level 62 elites. Lower level players might also want to consider skipping the cave marked with a red circle on the map. (depends on your gear/class)

![](/images/classic/mining-leveling-hinterlands.jpg)

Players below level 60 should skip the 4 caves marked with red circles.

![](/images/classic/mining-leveling-tanaris.jpg)

## 245 - 275

Ores in these zones: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_ore_mithril_02.jpg)Mithril Ore](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3858), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_ore_truesilver_01.jpg)Truesilver Ore](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7911), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_ore_thorium_02.jpg)Thorium Ore](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10620)

*   [Un'Goro Crater](#245-275-tab-1)
*   [Blasted Lands](#245-275-tab-2)
*   [Felwood](#245-275-tab-3)

There are 2-3 mineral veins in the two caves marked with the red circles on the map.

Lower level players should probably skip the cave to the south. It really depends on your level/gear/class.

![](/images/classic/mining-leveling-ungoro-small.jpg)

There are two caves marked with a red circle on the map, both of them have a lot of mobs inside, so I would only recommend this farming place to level 60 players with good gear, or for Druids and Rogues with stealth.

It's really hard to navigate inside the Garrison Armory mine, so I included a small map. **Alliance** players can't mine inside the Garrison Armory!

![](/images/classic/mining-leveling-blasted-lands.jpg)

There are usually 2 mining nodes insides the cave marked with a red circle. It's worth going inside the cave because it's not too large and there aren't that many mobs inside, and if you are high level, you can pass some of them without aggro.

I recommend skipping the other two caves at Jaednar, especially Shadow Hold. (maybe if you have stealth it's worth to go inside them)

![](/images/classic/mining-leveling-felwood.jpg)

## 275 - 300

Ores in these zones: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_ore_thorium_02.jpg)Thorium Ore](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10620), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_ore_mithril_02.jpg)Mithril Ore](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3858)

Now you can mine Rich Thorium Veins too.

*   [Un'goro Crater](#275-300-tab-1)
*   [Eastern Plaguelands](#275-300-tab-2)
*   [Winterspring](#275-300-tab-3)
*   [Burning Steppes](#275-300-tab-4)

Almost the same as the previous Un'Goro route, but now it includes Rich Thorium Veins.

![](/images/classic/mining-leveling-ungoro-rich.jpg)

The red line is filled with level 57-58 elites, so if you have bad gear, you should probably just skip that part entirely unless you have stealth. With some practice, you can usually get through only aggroing a few of them.

![](/images/classic/mining-leveling-eastern.jpg)

1.  The mobs in this cave are not that hard to kill, so it's worth clearing for most classes. (depends on gear)
2.  Most classes can enter at least the first part of the cave without pulling aggro. You can try going deeper depending on your gear.
3.  There are a lot of elites patroling inside this gorge, but you can usually pass most of them without pulling aggro. Sometimes you have to kill 1 or 2.
4.  This area is not recommended for most players because it's hard to farm here without dying. Really depends on your class and your experience in avoiding mobs.

![](/images/classic/mining-leveling-winterspring.jpg)

The two caves marked with red circles are filled with level 50 mobs, so lower level players might want to skip them. (depends on gear and level)
