# Classic WoW Lockpicking Leveling Guide 1-300

This Lockpicking guide will show you the fastest way how to get your Lockpicking skill up from 1 to 300

**The basic formula for your maximum lockpicking skill at a particular level is (5 \* level).** So, for example, if you have a level 20 character, your maximum lockpicking skill will be 100.

Click on the links below in the guide to see the exact location of all of these chests/lockboxes.

I recommend using [Zygor's 1-60 Leveling Guide](/recommends/zygor-classic-leveling) if you are still leveling your character or you just started a new alt. The guide is in a small window on your main screen in-game, all the detail that you need to complete the quests are included. You’ll never have to switch back to a website or even the in-game main map to see where you have to go or what’s next.

## 1 - 100

The [Buccaneer's Strongboxes](https://classicdb.ch/?object=123330) near Rachet in The Barrens respawn after a few seconds, so even two rogues can skill up there at the same time without trouble. **They are inside the ship** at the location marked on the map below.

There's another chest on the bottom of the ship called "The Jewel of the Southsea". Don't try to open this if you are low level, because it will spawn a mob that will kill you.

There are a bunch of [Practice Lockboxes](https://classicdb.ch/?object=178244) in Redridge Mountains north from Lake Everstill. These respawn really fast, so skilling up to 100 will be really easy.

## 100 - 150

Go to Zoram Strand in Ashenvale and look for [Waterlogged Footlockers](https://classicdb.ch/?object=179487) along the shore (on land).

## **150 - 200**

Go to Badlands - Angor Fortress. You will find two kinds of footlockers there. You will need a lockpicking skill of 175 to open the [Dentened Footlocker](https://classicdb.ch/?object=179492). Don't bother trying to Pick Pocket the mobs, the boxes are too low level, and they won't give any skill points.

*   [Battered Footlocker](https://classicdb.ch/?object=179490) - skill 150 - Upstairs
*   [Dented Footlocker](https://classicdb.ch/?object=179492) - skill 175 - Downstairs

## **200 - 250**

Go to the middle of Searing Gorge and go inside the cave called The Slag Pit, you will find a bunch of footlockers there. You should also try to Pick Pocket mobs to get a few [Sturdy Junkbox](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16884).

Stay on the lower part of the Slag Pit until you reach 225 because you can't open the lockboxes at the upper part yet.

## **250 - 300**

You can level the last 50 points in the Blackrock Depths (BRD) dungeon.

1.  After you enter, turn to the left, and unlock the first door.
2.  Then take the first right, and open the next door.
3.  Go left and open the first door.
4.  Go through the door and interact with the large wooden object sticking out of the ground below the giant gear.

Once you pick all 4 locks, go out, then reset the instance by right-clicking over your own portrait, then click the "Reset all instance" button. You can only do 5 instance runs in an hour, which means you can only get 20 skill points in an hour, but if you pickpocket a bunch of mobs during each run, then you will have enough Strong and Heavy Junkboxes to reach 300. Or you can just simply wait until you can go inside again.
