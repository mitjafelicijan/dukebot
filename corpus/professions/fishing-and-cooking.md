# Classic WoW Fishing & Cooking Leveling Guide 1-300

![](/images/icons/professions/fishing_n_cooking.png)

This Classic WoW Fishing and Cooking guide will show you the fastest way to level Fishing and Cooking from 1 to 300.

Since leveling your fishing takes a long time, it's best to level these professions together. You'll discover that it requires a lot of patience and time to build your skill level up to the maximum level. You will have to catch a lot of fish to get from start to finish.

I recommend using [Zygor's 1-60 Leveling Guide](/recommends/zygor-classic-leveling) if you are still leveling your character or you just started a new alt. The guide is in a small window on your main screen in-game, all the detail that you need to complete the quests are included. You’ll never have to switch back to a website, or even the in-game main map to see where you have to go or what’s next.

### Playing Cataclysm Classic?

There are a lot of changes to trainers and recipes in Cataclysm, so you should use my [Cataclysm Fishing and Cooking leveling guide](/cataclysm/fishing-and-cooking-leveling-guide-cataclysm-classic) instead.
