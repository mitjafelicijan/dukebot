# Classic WoW Fishing Leveling Guide 1-300

![](/images/icons/professions/fishing.png)This Classic WoW Fishing guide will show you the fastest way to level Fishing from 1 to 300. You'll discover that it requires a lot of patience and time to build your skill level up to the maximum level. You will have to catch a lot of fish to get from start to finish.

If you haven't leveled cooking yet, you should use my Fishing and Cooking leveling guide instead:

 [![](/images/icons/professions/fishing_n_cooking-s.png) Fishing & Cooking Leveling Guide 1-300](/classic/fishing-and-cooking-leveling-guide-classic-wow)

I recommend using [Zygor's 1-60 Leveling Guide](/recommends/zygor-classic-leveling) if you are still leveling your character or you just started a new alt. The guide is in a small window on your main screen in-game, all the detail that you need to complete the quests are included. You’ll never have to switch back to a website, or even the in-game main map to see where you have to go or what’s next.

## Fishing Trainers

To learn Fishing, you need to reach level 5 and find a Fishing trainer.

## 1 - 75

Buy a [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_fishingpole_02.jpg)Fishing Pole](https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=6256) and a few [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_orb_03.jpg)Shiny Bauble](https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=6529) from any Fishing Supply or Trade Supply merchant.

1.  Open up your Spellbook (P).
2.  Click on the General tab on the top right side of your spellbook and look for the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/trade_fishing.jpg)Fishing](https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=7731) spell.
3.  Drag the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/trade_fishing.jpg)Fishing](https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=7731) spell on your action bar.
4.  Equip your Fishing Pole and apply the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_orb_03.jpg)Shiny Bauble](https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=6529) lure.
5.  Go to any starting zone and look for a lake, pond, or river. Stand in front of the lake/river and press the fishing button.
6.  Mouse over the lure in the water, and when it splashes, right-click on it.
7.  Fish until you reach Fishing 75.

**Starting zones:** Dun Morogh, Durotar, Elwynn Forest, Mulgore, Teldrassil, Tirisfal Glades

**Remember, starting zones do not include capital cities!**

## 75 - 150

Go back to your trainer and learn Journeyman Fishing.

Fish until 150 in one of the capital cities:

*   Darnassus
*   Stormwind City
*   Orgrimmar
*   Undercity
*   Thunder Bluff

Alternatively, you can fish in any of these zones too: The Barrens, Darkshore, Ironforge, Loch Modan, Silverpine Forest, Westfall.

## 150 - 225

You can learn Expert Fishing from the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_book_08.jpg)Expert Fishing - The Bass and You](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16083) (requires level 20) book sold by [Old Man Heming](https://tbc.wowhead.com/npc=2626) at Booty Bay in Stranglethorn. He is in the middle of Booty Bay at the very bottom part, near a fishing sign. (You can also buy it at the Auction House) 

Buy a bunch of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_gem_variety_02.jpg)Bright Baubles](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6532) from [Old Man Heming](https://tbc.wowhead.com/npc=2626) before you leave.

Go to **Dustwallow Marsh**, apply [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_gem_variety_02.jpg)Bright Baubles](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6532) to your Fishing Pole and fish until 225.

I recommend fishing in Dustwallow because the Artisan Fishing Quest starts there, but you can fish in these zones too: Alterac Mountains, Arathi Highlands, Desolace, Stranglethorn Vale, Swamp of Sorrows, and Thousand Needles.

## Learning Artisan Fishing

To train Fishing past 225, you must complete the quest [![](/images/icons/quest_start.gif)Nat Pagle, Angler Extreme](https://tbc.wowhead.com/quest=6607) from [Nat Pagle](https://tbc.wowhead.com/npc=12919) in Dustwallow Marsh. (requires level 35 and Fishing 225)

To complete the quest, you have to catch 4 quest-only fish from different locations.

*   [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_monsterhead_02.jpg)Feralas Ahi](https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=16967) - Feralas
*   [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_fish_21.jpg)Misty Reed Mahi Mahi](https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=16970) - Swamp of Sorrows
*   [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_fish_32.jpg)Sar'theris Striker](https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=16968) - Desolace
*   [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_fish_08.jpg)Savage Coast Blue Sailfin](https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=16969) - Stranglethorn Vale

Use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_gem_variety_02.jpg)Bright Baubles](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6532) when you are fishing in **Feralas** to stop the fishes from getting away. You don't need any lures for the other zones because your fishing skill is high enough at this point.

#### Nat Pagle, Angler Extreme quest

![](/images/classic/artisan-fishing-quest-m.jpg)

## 225 to 300

After you completed the quest, fish in any of these zones:

*   Felwood
*   Feralas
*   The Hinterlands
*   Tanaris
*   Un'Goro Crater
*   Western Plaguelands

You will have to use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_gem_variety_02.jpg)Bright Baubles](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6532) in these zones to stop the fishes from getting away!
