# Classic WoW Leatherworking Leveling Guide 1-300

![](/images/icons/professions/leatherworking.png)This Classic WoW Leatherworking Leveling Guide will show you the fastest and cheapest way how to level your Leatherworking skill up from 1 to 300.

Leatherworking is the best combined with Skinning, and I highly recommend to level these professions together. It will be a lot easier to get the needed leathers if you have Skinning. You can also just buy the materials at the Auction House, but then you will need a lot of gold.

I recommend trying [Zygor's 1-60 Leveling Guide](/recommends/zygor-classic-leveling) if you are still leveling your character or just starting a new alt. It will help you to reach level 60 a lot faster.

    Make as many [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_pelt_bear_02.jpg)Cured Medium Hide](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4233) as you can if you farmed leathers and you got some Medium Hide. (or if it's cheap at the Auction House)
    
    Keep both the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_belt_04.jpg)Fine Leather Belt](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4246) and the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_pelt_bear_02.jpg)Cured Medium Hide](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4233) because you can make [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_belt_03.jpg)Dark Leather Belt](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4249) with them.
    

*   **125-137**

## Expert Leatherworking

To become an Expert Leatherworker you need to reach level 20 and level up Leatherworking to 125, then find an Expert Leatherworking trainer.

You can learn Expert Leatherworking from [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Telonis](/npc/classic/telonis) in Darnassus (Alliance) and [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Una](/npc/classic/una) in Thunder Bluff (Horde).

### 137 - 205

*   **137-150**  
    20x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_pants_09.jpg)Dark Leather Pants](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=7135) - 240 Medium Leather, 20 Gray Dye, 20 Fine Thread

*   **150-155**  
    7x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_leatherscrap_07.jpg)Heavy Leather](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20649) - 35 Medium Leather
    
    You can also make the following recipe:
    
    *   7x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_throwingball_01.jpg)Heavy Leather Ball](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18662) - 14 Heavy Leather, 7 Fine Thread
    
    The pattern is [sold by these NPCs](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18731#sold-by).
    

*   **155-165**  
    20x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_pelt_wolf_02.jpg)Cured Heavy Hide](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4236) - 20 Heavy Hide, 60 Salt
    
    You will need the Cured Heavy Hides later.
    
    Below you can find an alternative way if you don't have any Heavy Hides at all, which is usually the case since Heavy Hide has a pretty low drop rate. But if for example, you can get 5 Heavy Hides, you should stop making Barbaric Leggings at 195 and start making Guardian Gloves.
    
    *   155-180 - [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_armorkit_16.jpg)Heavy Armor Kit](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4265) - 175 Heavy Leather
    *   180-190 - [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_pants_02.jpg)Guardian Pants](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5962) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_pants_12.jpg)Barbaric Leggings](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5963) - 156 Heavy Leather, 26 Bolt of Silk Cloth or 100 Heavy Leather, 10 Moss Agate
    *   190-200 - [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_pants_12.jpg)Barbaric Leggings](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5963) - 130 Heavy Leather, 13 Moss Agate
    
    [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_scroll_03.jpg)Pattern: Barbaric Leggings](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5973) is [sold by these NPCs](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5973/pattern-barbaric-leggings#sold-by).
    

*   **165-180**  
    15x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_armorkit_16.jpg)Heavy Armor Kit](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4265) - 75 Heavy Leather, 15 Fine Thread

*   **180-190**  
    10x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_shoulder_08.jpg)Barbaric Shoulders](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5964) - 80 Heavy Leather, 10 Cured Heavy Hide, 20 Fine Thread

*   **190-200**  
    10x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_gauntlets_05.jpg)Guardian Gloves](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5966) - 40 Heavy Leather, 10 Cured Heavy Hide, 10 Silken Thread

*   **200-205**  
    5x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_armorkit_07.jpg)Thick Armor Kit](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=10487) - 25 Thick Leather, 5 Silken Thread

## Artisan Leatherworking

To become an Artisan Leatherworker you need to reach level 35 and level up Leatherworking to 200, then find an Artisan Leatherworking trainer.

Alliance players can learn it from [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Drakk Stonehand](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11097). He is in the main Wildhammer Keep in Aerie Peak of the Hinterlands, North of South Shore. He's sort of to the left inside, and down one layer of stairs.

For Horde players, the Artisan Leatherworking Trainer is [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Hahrana Ironhide](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11098) in Feralas at Camp Mojache.

### 205 - 260

*   **205-235**  
    40x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_belt_24.jpg)Nightscape Headband](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8176) - 200 Thick Leather, 80 Silken Thread
    
    You need a bit more Silken Thread to make these compared to the Thick Armor kits, but you can sell the Headbands to the vendor for a lot more, so they are actually cheaper than making the armor kits.
    

### Leatherworking Specializations

Once you reach Leatherworking skill level 225 and character level 40, you can choose one of the three Leatherworking specializations: Dragonscale, Elemental, or Tribal. Each specialization gives access to a specific set of patterns.

*   Dragonscale - Mail-type gear
*   Elemental - elemental resistance and Leather-type agility gear
*   Tribal - Leather-type intellect & agility gear and the Devilsaur Armor set

For information on how to become a Dragonscale, Elemental, or Tribal Leatherworker, please see my separate guides:

[Dragonscale](/classic/dragonscale-leatherworking-wow-classic) [Elemental](/classic/elemental-leatherworking-wow-classic) [Tribal](/classic/tribal-leatherworking-wow-classic)

*   **235-250**  
    15x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_pants_11.jpg)Nightscape Pants](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8193) - 210 Thick Leather, 60 Silken Thread

*   **250-260**  
    13x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_boots_05.jpg)Nightscape Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=10558) - 208 Thick Leather, 26 Heavy Silken Thread

### 260 - 290

33x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_gauntlets_31.jpg)Wicked Leather Gauntlets](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=19049) - 264 Rugged Leather, 33 Black Dye, 33 Rune Thread

The [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_scroll_03.jpg)Pattern: Wicked Leather Gauntlets](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15725) is sold by [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Leonard Porter](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=12942) in Western Plaguelands, and by [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Werg Thickblade](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=12943) in Tirisfal Glades. It's a limited supply pattern, so you have to wait if someone bought it before you. It has a really long respawn timer, so you should try to buy it from the Auction House, or farm the alternative recipe below.

#### Alternative recipe:

The recipe below requires Leatherworking 265 to learn, so you will also need 100-150 Thick Leather to make another 6-7 [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_boots_05.jpg)Nightscape Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=10558).

28x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_bracer_07.jpg)Wicked Leather Bracers](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15084) - 224 Rugged Leather, 28 Black Dye, 28 Rune Thread

[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_scroll_06.jpg)Pattern: Wicked Leather Bracers](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15728) is dropped by [Legashi Rogue](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=6201) in Azshara. It has a 5% drop rate, so you should also try to buy it from the Auction House if you don't want to grind mobs.

### 290 - 300

10x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_bandage_11.jpg)Runic Leather Headband](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=19082) - 140 Rugged Leather, 100 Runecloth, 10 Rune Thread

The [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_scroll_03.jpg)Pattern: Runic Leather Headband](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15756) is sold by [Jase Farlane](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=12941) in Eastern Plaguelands. It's a limited supply pattern, so you have to wait if someone bought it before you. This one also has a really long respawn timer.

#### Alternative recipes:

*   10x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_bandage_13.jpg)Wicked Leather Headband](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15086) - 120 Rugged Leather, 10 Black Dye, 10 Rune Thread
*   10x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_belt_23.jpg)Runic Leather Belt](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=19072) - 120 Rugged Leather, 100 Runecloth, 10 Rune Thread
*   12x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_bracer_11.jpg)Runic Leather Bracers](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=19065) - 72 Rugged Leather, 12 Black Pearl, 72 Runecloth, 12 Rune Thread
*   14x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_gauntlets_31.jpg)Runic Leather Gauntlets](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=19055) - 140 Rugged Leather, 84 Runecloth, 14 Rune Thread

The [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_scroll_06.jpg)Pattern: Wicked Leather Headband](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15744) is dropped by [Jadefire Tricksters](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=7107) in Felwood. It has a 2% drop rate, which is fairly low, so you should also try to buy it from the Auction House. If the recipe is cheaper than 100 Runecloth, then it's worth buying it.

The other three: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_scroll_06.jpg)Pattern: Runic Leather Belt](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15745), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_scroll_06.jpg)Pattern: Runic Leather Bracers](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15739), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_scroll_06.jpg)Pattern: Runic Leather Gauntlets](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15731) are all world drops, so you can't farm them directly (you shouldn't even try). But you can try to buy it from the Auction House.

  
Congratulations on reaching 300! Please [send feedback](/contact) about the guide if you think there are parts I could improve, or you found typos, errors, wrong material numbers!
