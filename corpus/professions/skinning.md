# Classic WoW Skinning Leveling Guide 1-300

![](/images/icons/professions/skinning.png)This Classic WoW Skinning Leveling Guide will show you the fastest way how to level your Skinning profession up from 1 to 300. If you leveling Skinning together with Leatherworking, you should also check out my [Classic WoW Leatherworking leveling guide](/classic/leatherworking-leveling-guide-classic-wow).

This guide is aimed at higher level players, who want to switch their profession at higher levels, but this doesn't mean it's not good for lower level players. Leveling your Skinning will be easy, but it's really boring. You will have to run around and skin hundreds or even thousands of mobs.

I recommend using [Zygor's 1-60 Leveling Guide](/recommends/zygor-classic-leveling) if you are still leveling your character or you just started a new alt. The guide is in a small window on your main screen in-game, all the detail that you need to complete the quests are included. You’ll never have to switch back to a website, or even the in-game main map to see where you have to go or what’s next.

#### Skinning skill requirement formula

These formulas will help you to figure out the Skinning skill needed to skin mobs, but if you follow the guide you don't need to worry about this.

*   Up to skinning 100, you can find out the highest level mob you can skin by: ((Skinning skill)/10)+10. Example: ( 50 / 10 ) +10 = 15
*   From skinning level 100 and up the formula is simply: (Skinning skill)/5. Example: (175 / 5 = 35)

#### Skinning guide sections

*   [1-75 Durotar, Dun Morogh](#1)
*   [75-155/165 The Barrens, Loch Modan, Wetlands](#75)
*   [155/165-205 Thousand Needles, Arathi Highland](#155)
*   [205-300 Un'Goro Crater, Feralas](#205)

## Durotar, Dun Morogh (1 - 75)

Visit any Skinning Trainer, and learn Skinning Apprentice. I recommend [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Balthus Stoneflayer](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=6291) in Ironforge or [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Thuwd](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=7088) in Orgrimmar. You can also walk up to a guard in any city and ask where the Skinning trainer is, then the trainer will be marked with a red flag on your map.

*   Don't forget to buy a [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_weapon_shortblade_01.jpg)Skinning Knife](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7005)! Leatherworking Supply vendors usually sell it near your trainer or any General/Trade goods vendor. This knife **does NOT have to be equipped**, but you can't skin mobs unless you have one in your bag.
    
*   If you enchant your gloves with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_note_01.jpg)Formula: Enchant Gloves - Skinning](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11166), then you can skin an enemy 1 level higher than you normally would be able to do so.
    
*   Please note that even if a **mob is red/orange to you, it DOES NOT guarantee that you'll get a skill up!** It's more likely, but not to be expected every time.

You can't skin the beasts in the immediate starting area because that area is for level 1-6 players, and you won't have any profession until you reach level 5.

Start at Sen'Jin Village in Durotar and head towards Orgrimmar while skinning every beast along the way.

Visit your trainer [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Thuwd](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=7088) when you reach Orgrimmar and learn Journeyman Skinning.

It's not guaranteed that you will reach 75, but if you don't reach it, you can still go to Orgrimmar. Skinning 50 will be enough too.

You can't skin the beasts in the immediate starting area because that area is for level 1-6 players, and you won't have any profession until you reach level 5.

From 1 to 50 make a circle around the lake near Ironforge. When you reach 50, go and visit your Skinning trainer [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Balthus Stoneflayer](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=6291) at Ironforge and learn Journeyman Skinning.

You can continue to level your Skinning until around 75, while you move toward Loch Modan. It's not guaranteed that you will reach 75, but if you won't reach it you can just still go to Loch Modan, lower skill will be enough too.

## The Barrens, Loch Modan, Wetlands (75 - 155/165)

*   [![](/images/icons/horde-m.png)Horde](#75-150-tab-1)
*   [![](/images/icons/alliance-m.png)Alliance](#75-150-tab-2)

From 75 to 125, skin the beasts along the way towards Camp Taurajo. Make sure that you reach Skinning 125 before you get to Camp Taurajo.

Find [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Dranh](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=6387) at Camp Taurajo and **learn Expert Skinning**.

Start heading towards Thousand Needles and skin the beasts along the way.

![](/images/farmingmaps/barrens-skinning-map.jpg)

Follow the path on the picture below until you reach 115, then head towards Wetlands. There might be a few beast in Wetlands that you can't skin if you go there with lower skinning skill.

![](/images/farmingmaps/loch-modan-skinning-map.jpg)

From 115 to around 140, follow that river you see on the picture and skin every beast along its way. You will get to around 140 by the time you reach Menethil Harbor, but **make sure to reach at least 125**.

Go to the flight master, and **fly to Ironforge**. Find [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Balthus Stoneflayer](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=6291) in Ironforge and learn Expert Skinning.

**Fly back to Wetlands** and continue leveling up your Skinning until 155 so you can skin the level 31 Raptors in Arathi.

## Thousand Needles, Arathi Highland (155/165 - 205)

*   [![](/images/icons/horde-m.png)Horde](#150-200-tab-1)
*   [![](/images/icons/alliance-m.png)Alliance](#150-200-tab-2)

From 165 to 205, follow the path you see on the map below. Make sure that you have Skinning 205 before you leave Thousand Needles.

After 205, **go to Tanaris and fly to Camp Mojache in Feralas**. Find [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Kulleg Stonehorn](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=8144) at Camp Mojache and learn Artisan Skinning.

![](/images/farmingmaps/Thousand-Needles-skinning-map.jpg)

Follow that path on the map from 155-170, then when you reach 170, you can head toward the orange 170-205 part because you can find higher level raptors there. There are also a few level 36-37 raptors at the southeast corner of the orange zone, don't go there until you have Skinning 180 because you can't skin them.

After you reach Skinning 205, **go to Ironforge and learn Artisan Skinning** from [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Balthus Stoneflayer](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=6291).

## Feralas, Un'Goro Crater (205 - 300)

From 205 to 230 just skin mobs around Camp Mojache, this one is doable for both Horde and Alliance. When you reach 230, mount up and head towards the Yeti cave, it's where you can see the 230-260 part on the map. If the Yeti cave is farmed by someone you can head to South and kill Hippogryphs.

After you reach 260, follow the path to the 260-280 part. There is another Yeti cave there, but those Yetis are higher levels. When you cleared the cave, you can find a lot of other beasts in front of the cave.

At Skinning 280 you can fly to Un'goro Crater, but you can also stay here and skill up your skinning by killing the beast in front of the cave.
