# Classic WoW Tailoring Leveling Guide 1-300

![](/images/icons/professions/tailoring.png)This Classic WoW Tailoring leveling guide will show you the fastest and easiest way how to get your Tailoring skill up from 1 to 300.

Tailoring uses cloths as main materials, but you don't need any gathering profession to gather cloths, so Tailoring can be combined with any gathering profession. One other popular choice is Enchanting because you can craft a bunch of cloths, disenchant them, and use the dust and essences to level your enchanting. Check out my [Classic WoW Enchanting leveling guide](/classic/enchanting-leveling-guide-classic-wow) if you want to level Enchanting.

I recommend trying [Zygor's 1-60 Leveling Guide](/recommends/zygor-classic-leveling) if you are still leveling your character or just starting a new alt. It will help you to reach level 60 a lot faster.

*   **230 - 250**  
    23x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_bandana_01.jpg)Black Mageweave Headband](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10024) - 69 Bolt of Mageweave, 46 Heavy Silken Thread

### 260 - 280

You can start making [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_bag_19.jpg)Runecloth Bag](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14046) instead of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_belt_15.jpg)Runecloth Belt](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13856) if you are going to sell them at the Auction House. The bags are more expensive to make, but you can get most of your gold back. Make the belts if you don't want to bother selling that many bags.

You can find where to buy the recipe at the 280-290 part below.

### 280 - 290

18x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_bag_19.jpg)Runecloth Bag](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14046) - 90 Bolt of Runecloth, 36 Rugged Leather, 18 Rune Thread

[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_scroll_03.jpg)Pattern: Runecloth Bag](https://www.wowhead.com/item=14468) is sold by [Qia](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11189) in Winterspring at Everlook. She is inside the Bank building, in the left corner as soon as you walk in.

It's a limited supply recipe, so if someone bought it before you, then you have to wait for it to respawn. The restock-time of this recipe seems to be random, it can anything between 5-90 minutes. It's usually better to just buy it from the Auction House if a lot of people are camping the NPC.

### 290 - 300

18x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_gauntlets_25.jpg)Runecloth Gloves](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13863) - 72 Bolt of Runecloth, 72 Rugged Leather, 18 Rune Thread

The recipe goes yellow at 290, get enough materials for 18.

[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_scroll_03.jpg)Pattern: Runecloth Gloves](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14481) is also sold by [Qia](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11189) in Winterspring, and it's also a limited supply recipe.

I hope you liked this Classic WoW Tailoring leveling guide, congratulations on reaching 300!
