# Classic WoW Alchemy Leveling Guide 1-300

![](/images/icons/professions/alchemy.png)This Classic WoW Alchemy Leveling guide will show you the fastest way how to level your Classic Alchemy skill up from 1 to 300 as inexpensively as possible.

Alchemy is the best combined with Herbalism, with these two you can save a lot of gold because you don't have to buy the herbs from the Auction House. Check out my [Classic Herbalism leveling guide 1-300](/classic/herbalism-leveling-guide-classic-wow) if you want to level herbalism.

I recommend trying [Zygor's 1-60 Leveling Guide](/recommends/zygor-classic-leveling) if you are still leveling your character or just starting a new alt. It will help you to reach level 60 a lot faster.

#### Alchemy guide sections:

*   [Materials required](#mats)
*   [Alchemy Trainers](#classic-alchemy-trainers)
*   [1-60 #Apprentice](#1)
*   [60-140 #Journeyman](#60)
*   [140-210 #Expert](#140)
*   [210-300 #Artisan](#210)

#### Approximate Materials Required:

There are a lot of yellow recipes used in the guide which means you won't gain skill points every single time. I added 10-20 extra herbs for most of these recipes, but it's still possible you will have to get a few more if you have the worst luck.

## Expert Alchemy

You can only train Alchemy past 150 if you learn Expert Alchemy. (Requires character level 20) Not every Alchemy trainer will teach you this skill, you will need to find an Artisan Alchemist.

#### Recipe to buy

Buy the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_scroll_03.jpg)Recipe: Superior Mana Potion](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13477) before you leave Darnassus / Undercity! You will need this recipe later at 265, so you can save some time if you buy it now while you are already close to the NPCs who sell it.

The recipe is sold by [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Ulthir](/npc/classic/ulthir) in Darnassus and by [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Algernon](/npc/classic/algernon) in Undercity. It's a limited supply item, so just keep checking until it's back "in stock" if someone bought it before you. (or buy it from the AH)

### 140 - 155

20 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_potion_71.jpg)Lesser Mana Potion](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3385) - 20 Mageroyal, 20 Stranglekelp, 20 Empty Vial

This recipe will be yellow for the last 10 points, so you might have to make a few extra.

Make [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_potion_38.jpg)Fire Oil](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=7837) if you don't have [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_herb_11.jpg)Stranglekelp](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3820) or if [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_monsterhead_01.jpg)Firefin Snapper](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6359) is cheap. You could also continue to make more [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_potion_51.jpg)Healing Potion](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=3447).

### 155 - 185

35 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_potion_52.jpg)Greater Healing Potion](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1710) - 35 Liferoot, 35 Kingsblood, 35 Leaded Vial

If you made [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_potion_38.jpg)Fire Oil](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=7837), you can use it to make [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_potion_33.jpg)Elixir of Firepower](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=7845)

### 185 - 210

30 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_potion_93.jpg)Elixir of Agility](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8949) - 30 Stranglekelp, 30 Goldthorn, 30 Leaded Vial

If you don't have that many Goldthorn, make [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_potion_72.jpg)Mana Potion](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=3452) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_potion_18.jpg)Lesser Invisibility Potion](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=3448) up to around 195.

If you don't have any Goldthorn at all, you can make [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_potion_06.jpg)Nature Protection Potion](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=7259) between 190-215

[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_scroll_03.jpg)Recipe: Nature Protection Potion](https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=6057) is sold by [these vendors](https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=6057). It's a limited supply item, so it can take a while to respawn when someone else purchases the recipe before you.

## Artisan Alchemy

You can only train Alchemy past 225 if you learn Artisan Alchemy. (Requires character level 35) Not every Alchemy trainer will teach you this skill, you will need to find a Master Alchemist.

Horde players can learn Artisan Alchemy from [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Rogvar](/npc/classic/rogvar) in Swamp of Sorrows at Stonard.

Alliance players can learn it from [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Kylanna Windwhisper](/npc/classic/kylanna-windwhisper) in Feralas at Feathermoon Stronghold.

It's a limited supply item, so just keep checking until it's back "in stock" if someone bought it before you. (or buy it from the AH) It's possible you already bought it when you trained Expert Alchemy, so check your inventory first.

### 285 - 300

The recipe is sold by [Evie Whirlbrew](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11188) in Winterspring at Everlook. It's a limited supply recipe, so you have to wait if someone bought it before you. (or buy it from the Auction House)
