# Classic WoW Engineering Leveling Guide 1-300

![](/images/icons/professions/engineering.png)This Classic WoW Engineering Leveling Guide will show you the fastest and easiest way how to level your Engineering skill up from 1 to 300.

Engineering is the best combined with Mining, if you level Engineering and Mining together you will save a lot of gold. Check out my [Classic Mining leveling guide 1-300](/classic/mining-leveling-guide-classic-wow) if you want to level Mining. If you don't have Mining you will have to buy everything from the Auction House.

I recommend trying [Zygor's 1-60 Leveling Guide](/recommends/zygor-classic-leveling) if you are still leveling your character or just starting a new alt. It will help you to reach level 60 a lot faster.

### Cataclysm Classic

There are a lot of changes to trainers and recipes in Cataclysm, so you should use my [Cataclysm Engineering leveling guide](/cataclysm/engineering-leveling-guide-cataclysm-classic) instead.

## Classic WoW Engineering Trainer Location

You can learn Classic Engineering from any of these NPCs below, but you have to reach level 5 before you can learn it.

Just click on any of these links below to see the trainer's exact location. You can also walk up to a guard in any city and ask where the Engineering trainer is, then it will be marked with a red flag on your map.

I recommend starting in Orgrimmar or Ironforge because you can also train Expert Engineering there so you can stay in one place until you reach 200. Trainers in other major cities will only teach you Journeyman recipes so you will have to go to Orgrimmar or Ironforge anyway.

**Horde trainers:**

*   [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Thund](/npc/thund-engineering-trainer-classic) in Orgrimmar.
*   [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Graham Van Talen](/npc/graham-van-talen-engineering-trainer-classic) in Undercity.
*   [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Twizwick Sprocketgrind](/npc/twizwick-sprocketgrind-engineering-trainer-classic) in Mulgore.
*   [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Mukdrak](/npc/mukdrak-engineering-trainer-classic) in Durotar.
*   [Tinkerwiz](/npc/tinkerwiz-engineering-trainer-classic) in The Barrens.

**Alliance trainers:**

*   [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Jemma Quikswitch](/npc/jemma-quikswitch-engineering-trainer-classic) in Ironforge.
*   [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Sprite Jumpsprocket](/npc/sprite-jumpsprocket-engineering-trainer-classic) in Stormwind City.
*   [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Jenna Lemkenilli](/npc/jenna-lemkenilli-engineering-trainer-classic) in Darkshore.
*   [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Bronk Guzzlegear](/npc/bronk-guzzlegear-engineering-trainer-classic) in Dun Morogh.

## Leveling Classic Engineering

Buy a [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_hammer_20.jpg)Blacksmith Hammer](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5956) from the Blacksmith / Engineering supply vendor, it's usually near your trainer. (or any general/trade goods vendor)

### Gnome Engineering skill racial bonus

**Gnome** characters have +15 Engineering skill because of their passive [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_gear_01.jpg)Engineering Specialization](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20593). An extra 15 Engineering skill means recipes stay orange 15 points longer, so you can save a lot of gold by doing lower level recipes for 15 more points.

*   **1 - 30**  
    60 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_dust_01.jpg)Rough Blasting Powder](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4357) - 60 Rough Stone
    
    You might even reach 40 with this recipe. You will need the 60 Rough Blasting Powder later, so keep these.
    

*   **30 - 50**  
    30 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_gear_06.jpg)Handful of Copper Bolts](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4359) - 30 Copper Bar
    
    You will need around 30 of these later.
    

*   **50 - 51**  
    1 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_wrench_01.jpg)Arclight Spanner](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6219) - 6 Copper Bar
    
    You will use this to craft engineering recipes so keep it.
    

*   **51 - 75**  
    30 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_bomb_09.jpg)Rough Copper Bomb](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4360) - 30 Copper Bar, 30 Handful of Copper Bolts, 60 Rough Blasting Powder, 30 Linen Cloth

## Journeyman Engineering (75 - 135)

You can only train Engineering past 75 if you learn Journeyman Engineering. Not every Engineering trainer will teach you this skill, you have to find an Expert Engineer. (Requires level 10)

You can learn Journeyman Engineering from these NPCs below:

**Horde trainers:**

    20 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_bomb_06.jpg)Coarse Dynamite](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4365) - 60 Coarse Blasting Powder, 20 Linen Cloth

*   **100 - 105**  
    5 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_ingot_04.jpg)Silver Contact](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4404) - 5 Silver Bar
    
    If Silver Bar is expensive you can make these:
    
    *   5x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_helmet_47.jpg)Flying Tiger Goggles](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=3934) - 30 Light Leather, 10 Tigerseye

    Start making [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_dust_06.jpg)Heavy Blasting Powder](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4377) if you don't have any Moss Agate, or it's really expensive.
    

## Expert Engineering (135 - 200)

You can only train Engineering past 150 if you learn Expert Engineering. Not every Engineering trainer will teach you this skill, you have to find an Artisan Engineer. (Requires level 20)

You can learn Expert Engineering from [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Roxxik](/npc/classic/roxxik) in Orgrimmar and from [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Springspindle Fizzlegear](/npc/classic/springspindle-fizzlegear) in Ironforge.

*   **135 - 150**
    
    *   30 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_dust_06.jpg)Heavy Blasting Powder](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4377) - 30 Heavy Stone
    *   15 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_gizmo_02.jpg)Whirring Bronze Gizmo](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4375) - 30 Bronze Bar, 15 Wool Cloth
    
    You will need 30 [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_dust_06.jpg)Heavy Blasting Powder](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4377) and 15 [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_gizmo_02.jpg)Whirring Bronze Gizmo](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4375) later, so make these now and you should reach 150 skill point.
    

*   **150 - 160**  
    15 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_gizmo_bronzeframework_01.jpg)Bronze Framework](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4382) - 30 Bronze Bar, 15 Medium Leather, 15 Wool Cloth
    
    Keep these too.
    
    By making them now, you might get a lot further - probably towards 160, then stop making these and only make more when you'll need them.
    

*   **160 -175**  
    15 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/spell_nature_polymorph.jpg)Explosive Sheep](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4384) - 30 Heavy Blasting Powder, 15 Whirring Bronze Gizmo, 15 Bronze Framework, 30 Wool Cloth
    
    Keep 5 of these, you might need it if you choose Goblin Engineering at 200.
    

*   **175 - 194**  
    60 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_powder_black.jpg)Solid Blasting Powder](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10505) - 120 Solid Stone
    
    Save these because you will need them later.
    

*   **194 -195**  
    1 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_screwdriver_02.jpg)Gyromatic Micro-Adjustor](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10498) - 4 Steel Bar
    
    Keep this, you will need it to craft some of the Engineering recipes.
    
    If you were unlucky with skill point gains and didn’t reach 195, craft a few more [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_bomb_08.jpg)Iron Grenade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=3962) or any other recipe that gives skill points.
    

*   **195 - 200**  
    7 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_musket_01.jpg)Mithril Tube](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10559) - 21 Mithril Bar
    
    Stop making these when you reach 200. Keep 6 Mithril Tubes, because you might need them if you choose Gnomish Engineering at 200.
    

## Artisan Engineering (200 - 300)

You can only train Engineering past 225 if you learn Artisan Engineering. Not every Engineering trainer will teach you this skill, you have to find a Master Engineer.

You can learn Artisan Engineering from [Buzzek Bracketswing](/npc/classic/buzzek-bracketswing) in Tanaris at Gadgetzan. (He's standing right outside the Inn, on the left side, near the mailbox.) You need to be level 35 or higher otherwise, he will tell you that you don't have the required level.

### Engineering Specializations

Engineering has the option at skill level 200 to specialize in Gnomish Engineer or Goblin Engineer. Some items require a specific specialization to use, while other items are crafted by one specialization but are usable by any engineer. Fortunately, most recipes that are crafted by one Specialization can be worn by both.

For information on how to choose a specialization, please see my separate guide:

[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/trade_engineering.jpg)Guide to Engineering Specializations](/classic/engineering-specializations-classic-wow)

*   **200 - 215**  
    20 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_battery_01.jpg)Unstable Trigger](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10560) - 20 Mithril Bar, 20 Mageweave Cloth, 20 Solid Blasting Powder
    
    Save these.
    

*   **215 - 238**  
    40 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_gizmo_mithrilcasing_01.jpg)Mithril Casing](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10561) - 120 Mithril Bar
    
    Save these.
    

*   **238 - 250**  
    20 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_bomb_07.jpg)Hi-Explosive Bomb](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10562) - 40 Mithril Casings, 20 Unstable Trigger, 40 Solid Blasting Powder

*   **250 - 260**  
    30 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_misc_ammo_gunpowder_01.jpg)Dense Blasting Powder](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15992) - 60 Dense Stone
    
    You might need to make more than 30 to reach 260.
    

*   **260 - 285**  
    35 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_gizmo_04.jpg)Thorium Widget](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15994) - 105 Thorium Bar, 35 Runecloth
    
    The recipe is sold by [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Gearcutter Cogspinner](/npc/classic/gearcutter-cogspinner) in Ironforge and by [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Sovik](/npc/classic/sovik) in Orgrimmar.
    
    It will be yellow for the last few points, so you might not reach 285. But you can just go to the next step. (you have to make a bit more from the next recipe)
    

*   **285 - 300**  
    20 x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_gizmo_pipe_04.jpg)Thorium Tube](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16000) - 120 Thorium Bar
    
    [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_scroll_03.jpg)Schematic: Thorium Tube](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16047) is sold by [Xizzer Fizzbolt](/npc/classic/xizzer-fizzbolt) in Winterspring at Everlook in the first building to the right.
    

I hope you liked this Classic Engineering leveling guide, congratulations on reaching 300!
