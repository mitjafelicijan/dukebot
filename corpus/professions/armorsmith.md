# Armorsmith Specialization in WoW Classic

Armorsmithing is a Blacksmithing specialization that allows access to craft powerful armor recipes. This guide will show you step by step how to become an Armorsmith in Classic WoW.

You must level your character to **level 40** and have at least **200 Blacksmithing skill** before you can choose a Blacksmithing specialization. Check out my [WoW Classic Blacksmithing leveling guide](/classic/blacksmithing-leveling-guide-classic-wow) if your skill is not high enough.

## Armorsmith quest

To become an Armorsmith, you must first talk to [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Krathok Moltenfist](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11176) in Orgrimmar or [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Myolor Sunderfury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11145) in Ironforge and click on "I wish to become an armorsmith".

Then go to the nearby Armorsmith trainer [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Grumnus Steelshaper](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=5164) (Alliance) or [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Okothos Ironrager](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11177) (Horde) and pick up the quest [![](/images/icons/quest_start.gif)The Art of the Armorsmith](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5283).

To complete the quest, you will need:

*   4x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_helmet_10.jpg)Ornate Mithril Helm](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9980)
*   2x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_boots_01.jpg)Ornate Mithril Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9979)
*   1x [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_chest_plate10.jpg)Ornate Mithril Breastplate](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9972)

### Where to learn recipes?

You have to complete a long quest chain for "The Mithril Order" if you want to learn to craft the recipes required to complete the Armorsmith quest.

But, **you don't actually have to craft these yourself to get credit for completing the quest.** You just have to have the items in your inventory. You can ask someone who already completed the quests to craft them for you, or you can buy all of them from the Auction House.

## Required material list

This is the full list of materials required to complete both the "The Mithril Order" quests below and [![](/images/icons/quest_start.gif)The Art of the Armorsmith](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5283) quest above.

## The Mithril Order quest chain

I just want to mention again that these quests are not required to become an Armorsmith. The only requirement to become an Armorsmith is to complete [![](/images/icons/quest_start.gif)The Art of the Armorsmith](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5283) quest.

If you know someone who already completed the quests, or you can buy the armors from the Auction House, you don't have to complete this quest chain.
