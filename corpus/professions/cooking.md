# Classic WoW Cooking Leveling Guide 1-300

![](/images/icons/professions/cooking.png)This Classic WoW Cooking leveling guide will show you the fastest way how to level your Cooking skill up from 1 to 300 as inexpensively as possible.

Often the materials are based on a case that you will gain one skill point for each craft. This won't happen, so you will have to buy a few extra materials while you are leveling your Cooking.

If you also want to level Fishing but haven't leveled it yet, you should use my Fishing and Cooking leveling guide instead:

 [![](/images/icons/professions/fishing_n_cooking-s.png) Fishing & Cooking Leveling Guide 1-300](/classic/fishing-and-cooking-leveling-guide-classic-wow)

I recommend trying [Zygor's 1-60 Leveling Guide](/recommends/zygor-classic-leveling) if you are still leveling your character or just starting a new alt. It will help you to reach level 60 a lot faster.
