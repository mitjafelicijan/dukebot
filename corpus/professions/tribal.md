## Wild Leather Quests

To become a Tribal Leatherworker, you must first complete the prerequisite Wild Leather quests.

**Make sure that you have all the needed materials before you head out**, or you will have to travel back to the Auction House to buy more.

Go to Feralas and find [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Pratt McGrubben](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=7852) / [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Jangdor Swiftstrider](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=7854).

Complete all 7 of the following quests:

*   [![](/images/icons/quest_start.gif)Wild Leather Armor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=2854) - This will open up the next five.
*   [![](/images/icons/quest_start.gif)Wild Leather Vest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=2856)
*   [![](/images/icons/quest_start.gif)Wild Leather Shoulders](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=2855)
*   [![](/images/icons/quest_start.gif)Wild Leather Leggings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=2859)
*   [![](/images/icons/quest_start.gif)Wild Leather Helmet](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=2857)
*   [![](/images/icons/quest_start.gif)Wild Leather Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=2858)
*   [![](/images/icons/quest_start.gif)Master of the Wild Leather](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=2860) - You will get this once you complete all 6 quests above.

The [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/small/inv_scroll_03.jpg)Pattern: Turtle Scale Gloves](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8385) is the only recipe that you have to buy. The rest of them are taught by your trainer. The quest giver NPC sells the recipe, but it's a limited supply item, so you have to wait if someone bought it before you. The re-stock time is random, but it's around 30 minutes. (or buy it from the Auction House)

Go to Darnassus Thunder Bluff, find [![](/images/icons/alliance.png)Telonis](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=4212) [![](/images/icons/horde.png)Una](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=3007)Â and complete the last quest [![](/images/icons/quest_start.gif)Master of the Wild Leather](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=2860).
